<span class="cheaderfont">THE STORY OF THE OLD WINDMILL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Why not climb up into this battered old
windmill, Amos, and take an observation?”</p>

<p>“Now, that’s a good idea, Jack, only we’d better
be mighty careful about showing ourselves
too recklessly, you know.”</p>

<p>“You mean that there might be German raiding
parties skirmishing around this section of
country, don’t you, Amos?”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve had to hide twice today when we
glimpsed suspicious squadrons galloping across
the fields, or covering some far-off road. And
you remember that one of them bore the stamp
of Uhlans in their lances with the fluttering
pennons, their dirt-colored uniforms, and the
spiked helmets.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[6]</span></p>

<p>“Oh! we’ll try and not show ourselves, Amos;
but since we’re a little mixed up in our bearings
this seems too good a chance to lose.”</p>

<p>“These Dutch-style windmills we’ve run across
in this strip of Belgium do make mighty good
lookouts and observation towers. I warrant you
some of them have figured heavily in the ebb
and flow of the war.”</p>

<p>“This one has for a fact, Amos,” remarked
the young fellow called Jack, as he pointed at
numerous jagged holes in the concrete foundation,
where evidently a storm of bullets had
struck. “You can see how it’s been bombarded
on all sides; and that top corner on the left was
torn off by a passing shell. Here inside is a pile
of empty brass cartridge-cases that tells the
story as plain as print.”</p>

<p>“Made in Germany they were as sure as you
live, and used in a rapid-fire gun at that, Jack.
Yes, it’s all written out before us. Here in this
concrete base of the windmill tower, some daring
gun squad of the Kaiser’s men took up their
stand with their outfit, and held the Allies off<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
as long as their ammunition lasted. I wonder
what happened then, Jack?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a hunch we’ll find out something
after we get up where we can look around a bit.
But come on, let’s climb this ladder to the upper
part of the windmill. Have a care how you trust
your whole weight on anything, because they’ve
riddled the place for keeps.”</p>

<p>While the two boys climb upwards with the
intention of taking a look around and getting
their bearings, we might as well become better
acquainted with them, and learn what sort of
mission it was that brought two American lads
over to the battle-scarred fields of Southwestern
Belgium at such a perilous time.</p>

<p>Jack Maxfield and Amos Turner were first
cousins, and the latter lived in one of the best-known
suburbs of Chicago; while Jack, being
an orphan, was in the habit of saying that “his
home was wherever he happened to hang his
hat.”</p>

<p>Both boys were passionately fond of outdoor
life, but fortune had allowed Jack to spend several<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
years on a Western ranch, where he accumulated
a fund of knowledge through actual
experience; while Amos had to be content with
what he could pick up through reading, theorizing,
and association with a Boy Scout troop.</p>

<p>Jack had been left with independent means,
and chanced to be visiting at the home of
Colonel Turner, his uncle, at the time a strange
event took place which resulted in the dispatch
of the two boys across the ocean, bent upon an
errand of mercy. Just what that mission was
the reader will learn by listening to the conversation
between the two boys after they reached
the top of the windmill tower. Day and night
it bore heavily on the mind of Amos, so that he
frequently found himself sighing, and seeking
consolation in the reassuring words his cousin
was so ready to pour out.</p>

<p>After some little effort they managed to pull
themselves up and land on the top of the windmill
base. Roughly treated under the bombardment
to which, as a fortress, it had been subjected,
the material was crumbling in numerous<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
places. The boys, however, had no trouble in
finding room on the top. Overhead arose one of
the gaunt arms with its tattered sail; another had
been shattered by the same shell that had torn
the corner away, and lay in a heap close by.</p>

<p>Taking a hasty look all around, the two boys
quickly discovered several things that held their
interest.</p>

<p>“Amos,” said Jack, gravely, “you were wondering
what had become of the Germans who
defended this place against all opposition. If
you will look down there where that willow tree
grows alongside the brook you’ll understand.”</p>

<p>“Fresh-made graves, sure enough, Jack!” exclaimed
the other, with a quick intake of his
breath. “Like as not they held out till the last
man went under. And some of their comrades
passing this way stopped long enough to cover
the brave fellows with two feet of earth. That’s
about all a soldier can expect these days.”</p>

<p>“I can guess what’s in your mind when you
sigh that way, Amos. You’re wondering
whether your brother Tom is still alive, or has<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
found a grave like hundreds of thousands of
others in this terrible war.”</p>

<p>“We’ve reason to believe he changed his name
and joined the British forces, not caring much
whether he survived or perished,” said Amos,
with a look of pain on his young face. “You
know he always was a reckless fellow. He is
nearly ten years older than I. Father was very
strict, and couldn’t understand that high-spirited
Tom was one of those who could be led, but
never driven. Then came that awful accusation&mdash;oh!
it makes me shiver to think of that
time.”</p>

<p>“Your father accused Tom of taking his pocketbook
from a drawer of his desk, and everything
seemed to point to him as the thief. You
say Tom denied being guilty but was too proud
to say anything more. And so he was driven
from home, and has never been seen since that
time&mdash;is that it, Amos?”</p>

<p>“Yes, though I’ve had a few lines from him
about once in six months,” replied the other boy,
slowly. “First he went to California; then I<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
heard from him in Japan; and the last time it
was in England, where he said he had enlisted
under another name, and meant to fight for the
Allies, not caring much what happened.”</p>

<p>“Did your father ever know you had heard
from him?” asked Jack, as he continued to use
his eyes to advantage, and examine the surrounding
country from the elevated lookout.</p>

<p>“I didn’t dare show him the postcards that
came to me,” replied Amos. “He is such a
stern martinet, you know, or rather was up to
a month ago, when that queer thing happened.
Father made a name for himself as a soldier
during the Spanish war. He had told me to
consider that my brother was dead, and so I
was afraid to tell him about those cards. If
our mother had only lived all this terrible trouble
would never have happened, for she knew how
to handle high-spirited Tom.”</p>

<p>“Tell me again about that day the discovery
was made, Amos; of course I’ve heard the story,
but I’d like to get it all fresh in my mind.”</p>

<p>“It happened in this way,” replied the other,<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
who had come to lean on his cousin more or less
since they had grown to be chums, “one of the
drawers of father’s desk seemed to stick with
the pile of papers in it, and he asked me to get it
out. I can see him now, sitting there and watching
me work at it, with that set look on his face
that has been there ever since he sent poor Tom
away.”</p>

<p>“One of the papers was missing, you told me,
and you thrust your hand in where the drawer
had come from so as to get hold of it?” remarked
Jack, eagerly, as though in imagination
he could picture the intensely thrilling scene.</p>

<p>“Yes, and when I hastily drew my hand out
and held up what I had found there in the cavity
where the drawer had been I thought my father
would fall back dead in his chair, he was so
stunned. His face turned as white as chalk, and
he held his breath ever so long.”</p>

<p>“It was the lost pocketbook, of course?” continued
Jack.</p>

<p>“Nothing less,” said Amos, tragically; “you
see, it must have been lying on top of all those<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
papers and was dragged off when the drawer
was opened long ago. Every cent was in it untouched.
Father swooned away with the shock,
and has never been himself since. He can’t
sleep nights, and keeps muttering all the while
about his cruel injustice to poor Tom.”</p>

<p>“Of course you showed him the cards from
your brother, Amos?”</p>

<p>“Yes, as soon as he was in a condition to understand,”
replied the other. “From that hour he
has had only one thing in his mind, which was
that some one must find Tom and fetch him
home. Father says he can’t live much longer,
and that he is praying every day that he might
ask his boy to forgive him before he goes.”</p>

<p>“And so we’ve come across to try and find
Tom,” Jack went on to say, “though since he’s
changed his name it’s like looking for a needle
in a haystack; but we’ve managed to pick up a
clue, and there’s a faint chance of our running
across him before a great while.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I hope so, I hope so, Jack,” said the
other, fervently. “Every time I shut my eyes I<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
seem to see poor father’s face before me. The
look of pain on it haunts me. I would give almost
anything if only I could find Tom and take
him back home with me. I believe it would give
father new life. But what a small chance we’ve
got to run across my brother in an army of half
a million men, when we’re not even sure of the
name he’s known by. He may have fallen long
ago in one of those fierce drives the Germans
made on the British lines.”</p>

<p>“Keep hoping for the best, Amos,” the Western
boy told him, cheerily, for Jack was always
seeing the silver lining in the cloud. “Something
whispers to me that sooner or later we’re bound
to succeed, and that when we start back across
the Atlantic we’ll have your brother Tom in tow.
But there’s one thing we’ve got to make sure
of, and that is to keep clear of the Germans.
Once we fall into their hands they’d send us
into Germany as prisoners of war, no matter how
we proved we were American boys. And that
would ruin our game.”</p>

<p>“So far we’ve been helped in a lot of ways by<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
the Allied officers,” remarked Amos, trying to
pluck up fresh courage and hope. “My father
happened to have good friends among the military
people over in England, and they gave me
a paper that has been worth a heap to us here.
Only for that we’d never have been allowed to
get as far as we have toward the firing line. But
what are you staring so hard at, Jack?”</p>

<p>The other for answer drew his companion still
further down as though he had made an unpleasant
discovery that promised them fresh trouble.
Accustomed to the great distances of the Western
prairies, Jack’s eyes were like those of the
eagle, and he could see objects that might have
passed unheeded by others.</p>

<p>“There’s something moving over yonder
where that low hill rises,” he hastened to inform
Amos. “If you look close you can see a whole
string of objects bobbing up and down as if on
galloping horses. I think, Amos, they are the
little pennons at the tip-end of Uhlan lances; and
that a detachment of the rough-riding corps
must be coming this way!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[16]</span></p>

<p>“Then they’ll be pretty sure to head for this
windmill as soon as they round the base of the
hill,” exclaimed Amos, hurriedly, looking much
concerned.</p>

<p>“It’s apt to draw them as the needle is attracted
to the pole,” ventured the second boy.
“In this country every place that affords a lookout
is taken advantage of by friend and foe alike.
Which means that since it’s too late now for us
to skip out without being seen and chased, we’ll
have to hide ourselves here and wait for the
coast to clear. Come, there’s no time to lose,
Amos!”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II" class="no-break">CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A MOMENT OF PERIL.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Both boys seemed as active as cats; and evidently
Jack must have looked around him with
an eye to a possible hiding-place for he immediately
led his companion to a cavity into which
they could crawl and remain unseen.</p>

<p>They only waited long enough to make sure
it was a band of horsemen turning the hill, that
they were beyond doubt Uhlans, and that they
were now heading in a direct line for the windmill.</p>

<p>“That settles it,” observed Jack, decisively.
“They mean to make use of this observation post;
so let’s dodge out of sight, Amos.”</p>

<p>A minute later and both boys were huddling
under cover at a place where some of the wreckage
of the arm of the sail together with other
debris had been thrown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[18]</span></p>

<p>“Let’s hope none of them think it worth while
to stick a sword in here to see what’s under all
this stuff,” ventured Amos.</p>

<p>“I hardly think they’ll go to any bother,” his
companion observed. “You see, when these
Uhlans are riding over hostile territory they are
always in a big hurry to cover as much ground
as they can. They stir up a hornets’ nest wherever
they go, and the quicker they change base
the better for them. I reckon a couple of the
officers will climb up here with their field-glasses
so as to take an observation. Then they’ll be
off again, and only hit the high places as they
ride away.”</p>

<p>“They can tell easily enough that there’ve been
warm times around this windmill a short time
back,” suggested Amos. “Let’s hope their powerful
glasses show them a bunch of the British
forces moving this way. That would help hurry
them along, according to my notion.”</p>

<p>“’Sh! keep still now, because they’re getting
close up. Use your ears all you want to, but say
nothing even in a whisper.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[19]</span></p>

<p>Thrilled by the fact that danger was hovering
over them, the boys crouched there in their place
of concealment and waited to ascertain what
would happen. Although Amos did not claim
to possess such acute hearing as his chum, he too
could by now catch the thud of many horses’
hoofs beating on the earth. The sound grew in
volume constantly, showing that the Uhlan
party must be heading directly toward the site
of the Dutch windmill, just as Jack had figured
would be the case.</p>

<p>Suddenly the heavy beat of many hoofs ceased,
and the concealed boys could hear a clanking of
accoutrements, accompanied by snorts of horses
brought to a standstill.</p>

<p>Jack nudged his comrade to signify that the
crisis had arrived. Then they caught the sound
of heavy voices, and the guttural nature of the
utterance, so different from French or even English,
told them it was German, though as yet no
word came distinctly to their ears.</p>

<p>Some one was undoubtedly climbing the ladder
that led to the top of the concrete and stone<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
foundation of the windmill; Jack could tell this
from the slight quivering sensation that he felt.
As he had anticipated, the Uhlan meant to utilize
the windmill as a lookout. He only hoped
that a short confinement in their uncomfortable
quarters might be the whole extent of the experience
to which he and Amos would be subjected.</p>

<p>Louder came the voices. The speakers were
now close at hand, and had evidently succeeded
in gaining the flat top of the structure without
any accident on account of the shaky ladder
giving way under their weight.</p>

<p>It happened that both boys had a smattering
of the German language. On the way over they
had spent many hours on deck brushing up their
knowledge from books secured with that very
idea in view. Hence they could make out fairly
well what was said, though at times the translation
might seem a little hazy, and subject to
doubt.</p>

<p>The party with the rasping voice seemed to be
the leading officer, for he presently ordered some<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
one else to climb further up, using the perpendicular
arm of the windmill for the purpose, so
as to get a better view of the surrounding country
from its apex.</p>

<p>The hidden boys could hear the shaky arm
groan under the weight of the climber, while the
ragged remnant of the sail flapped in the breeze.
Every second they anticipated a crash that would
tell of disaster, but it did not come; and Jack
realized that nothing was too venturesome for
those recklessly hard riders.</p>

<p>Evidently the officer with the glasses must
have reached the point which he had been aiming
for, since presently he started making his report,
the man below interrupting occasionally to ask
pertinent questions.</p>

<p>From his lofty eyrie the one on the lookout
must have been able to scan considerable territory,
for he reported that only in one direction
was there any sign of the enemy in force. Off
toward the east he could see artillery in motion,
accompanied by a regiment or two of British territorials,<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
and evidently heading for the front to
take their place in the battle line.</p>

<p>Further questioning revealed the fact that an
aeroplane was in sight, apparently belonging to
the Allies, and evidently scouting in the interests
of the new field battery that was seeking a
position where it could do the most damage to
the trenches of the invaders.</p>

<p>The presence of this speedy air-craft seemed
to make the commander of the Uhlans somewhat
uneasy. He knew how easily the birdman could
swoop down toward them and drop a few bombs
with the intention of doing fell execution in their
midst. If the air scout had manifested any interest
in their presence there, and headed toward
the spot, undoubtedly a hoarse command would
have caused a hurried scattering of the rough
riders, just as wild ducks separate when the eagle
darts down for his dinner.</p>

<p>Now the observer was going down again to
join his chief, who possibly would want to ask a
few more questions before definitely deciding on<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
the course they must take after leaving the
windmill.</p>

<p>Amos was almost holding his breath because
of the suspense. The Uhlan captain had seated
himself on the pile of rubbish and was now
within two feet of where the boys lay in concealment.
It seemed to the anxious Amos that the
very beating of his heart would betray them, so
wildly was it pounding against his ribs.</p>

<p>Once again did the captain fling his queries
at the other. Surrounded as they were with
hostile forces it meant considerable to the Uhlans
that they pick out the line of least resistance. It
was also of importance to them that they appear
in places where German soldiers were least
expected. In this way, by the very boldness of
their dash, they might help strike terror to the
hearts of the villagers, wherever a collection of
houses had still escaped the general destruction
that had visited that sadly harassed section of
country.</p>

<p>Amos was undoubtedly a better German
scholar than his Western cousin, and could<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
therefore understand what was passing between
the two men. Jack felt him give a violent start
once or twice, from which he guessed the other
had caught something said which had seemed
to have escaped his ears. It was no time to indulge
in a whisper, however, and so he had to
possess his soul in patience, and wait for a more
fitting opportunity to learn what had upset his
chum.</p>

<p>Once the Uhlan captain spoke of the fierce
fight that must have taken place at the battered
windmill, showing that he had read all the signs
aright, even to the freshly turned earth over under
the willow tree on the bank of the little
brooklet near by.</p>

<p>There was a note of pride in his raspy voice
when he spoke of the apparent fact that those
who had used the buttress of the windmill for a
fort must have held out until every man of them
had been slain. In the eyes of a German such
devotion to the dearly beloved Fatherland was
only what might be expected.</p>

<p>When the captain rose from his hard seat,<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
Amos for one terrible moment feared that the
catastrophe he had dreaded was about to
descend upon them, for he heard the second man
make a remark that brought things directly
home.</p>

<p>“Do you think our brave comrades could have
found and buried all those who fell here, Captain,
after first accounting for scores of the detested
British?” was what he said.</p>

<p>Even as he spoke he bent down and tried to
see under the pile of wreckage; and certainly
both boys held their breath. But Fortune was
kind to them, for it happened that the sun was
under a cloud, and the man’s eyes could not
penetrate the gloom that lay around them.</p>

<p>“Even if they did not, what does it matter?”
remarked the commander. “A soldier needs no
tomb. It is enough that he has done his duty
toward his country and his emperor. If there
should by chance be a body uncared for it will
soon be buried just the same. Come, let us be
going, Lieutenant Krueger. The horses will
be all the fresher for this short halt. Twenty<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
miles we should cover before sunset, and strike
terror to thousands of French hearts with our
passage through the land!”</p>

<p>Yes, thank fortune they were going now. The
eyes of the lieutenant had been unequal to the
task of seeing what lay under all that piled-up
rubbish; and he did not think it worth while to
thrust in with his sword. Amos was breathing
freely again, though far from easy in his mind.</p>

<p>Now they knew the men were climbing
down from the elevation. The horses had become
restive, as though eager to be once more
on the mad gallop to which they were so accustomed.
Amos had reached out his hand and
found that of his chum, to which he was clinging,
squeezing Jack’s fingers convulsively as
though he might be laboring under a tremendous
strain.</p>

<p>“In luck again, you see, Amos,” whispered
Jack, managing to get his lips close to the ear
of his companion. “They’re going off in a hurry,
and without finding us. Why, you’re quivering<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
like a leaf, I do believe. What ails you, old
chap?”</p>

<p>“Oh! then you didn’t hear what he said, or
you wouldn’t be taking it so cool,” replied Amos,
in a guarded tone, and trying at the same time
to control his voice, which trembled in spite of
him.</p>

<p>“Well, I own up I did miss some of his growl,
but what of that?” confessed Jack. “Was there
anything in particular he said that meant trouble
for you and me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” answered the other, in a gasp.
“He told the lieutenant they wouldn’t want to
leave such a splendid lookout to be used by the
enemy, and that it must be destroyed!”</p>

<p>“What, this windmill, do you mean?” demanded
Jack, himself thrilled by the news.</p>

<p>“He said they ought to leave a bomb with a
short fuse behind them, and the last man away
would put a match to it!” Amos volunteered.</p>

<p>The Western boy may have been startled by
what he heard, but it was Jack’s way never to
show the white feather. He even whistled softly<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
half under his breath; for the trampling of many
hoofs down below served to make it impossible
for ordinary sounds to be heard, so there seemed
no possible danger of the chums being betrayed
by their low conversation.</p>

<p>“That’s a nice outlook I must say,” chuckled
Jack, pretending to make light of the threatening
peril. “For one, I’m not hankering to climb
the golden stairs in such a hurry. I tell you
what we’ve got to do, Amos.”</p>

<p>“Wish you would, Jack, and be quick about
it,” urged the other. “There, some of them are
riding off right now, and the rest will follow on
their heels. Then that last man is to touch a
match to the fuse and hurry away. They expect
to see the mill go shooting skyward in pieces
before they get far off.”</p>

<p>“What d’ye reckon we’ll be doing along about
that time, I’d like to know?” chuckled Jack.
“Let’s crawl out of this in a hurry, so as to be
ready to act. Then when we glimpse that last
rider whooping it up in a hurry you’ll see how<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
fast I’ll drop down the old ladder and jump on
that burning fuse.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t think we’d better run for it,
Jack? You reckon they might see us and give
chase? I guess you’re right about that, too.
But listen, isn’t that the clatter of a single horse
starting off with a rush?”</p>

<p>“Yes, there goes the man who fired the fuse;
it’s time we were on the move if we want to
stamp out that slow match,” and Jack as he spoke
jumped for the ladder.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_III" class="no-break">CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE BATTLE IN THE AIR.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Let me go first, won’t you, Jack, please?”</p>

<p>There was no time for argument, so the other
stepped aside and permitted his chum to pass
down the ladder that led from the lower part
of the structure. Since haste was a prime object
with the boys just then it can be understood that
they made record time, and were at the bottom
almost “between breaths,” as Jack put it.</p>

<p>“I hear it sputtering somewhere!” exclaimed
Amos, excitedly, as he turned this way and that
without apparently being able to make any sort
of discovery.</p>

<p>“And I can smell burnt powder plainly!”
echoed Jack, not content to stand still and look
around, but beginning a hasty search.</p>

<p>It was a moment of intense anxiety to both
lads. They could not tell how long a fuse had<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>
been left by the trooper who was the last to ride
away. He had seemed to be in something of a
hurry, though this might spring from a desire
to catch up with his comrades before they had
gone very far on their way.</p>

<p>Jack used common-sense in his search. He
noted first of all which way the air current was
setting, and this told him the fumes of the burning
powder must be coming toward him from
a certain quarter.</p>

<p>When the other boy, actually shivering with
suspense, saw Jack give a sudden leap forward
and strike downward with his foot he judged
that the other must have made an important discovery
of some sort.</p>

<p>“Did you find it?” he asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes, come here and see,” Jack told him.</p>

<p>Upon looking, Amos discovered the bomb,
which was only a small affair, though no doubt
of tremendous power, for those Germans were
master-hands at manufacturing terrible weapons
of destruction, chemistry being one of their
strongest holds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[32]</span></p>

<p>“Oh! you got it just in time, seems like, Jack,”
observed Amos, as he noted the short fuse remaining
after his cousin had extinguished the
fire.</p>

<p>“It might have lasted half a minute longer, I
reckon,” said Jack, coolly. “Plenty of time for
us to get clear, if only we hadn’t been afraid of
being seen by the cavalrymen.”</p>

<p>“What next?” demanded Amos, who many
times felt willing to put the responsibility of affairs
on the broad shoulders of his chum.</p>

<p>“We must get out of this, that’s sure,” replied
Jack. “The only thing I don’t like is that when
there isn’t an explosion that trooper may think
it his duty to gallop back here again so as to
start things afresh.”</p>

<p>“But we ought to be somewhere among the
bushes by that time, hadn’t we?” suggested
Amos, uneasily.</p>

<p>“I have a better plan than that,” he was informed.
“By now the man who fired the fuse
is out of sight. I imagine he has drawn in his
horse, and is waiting to hear the explosion.<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>
Amos, get outside where you can skip along
when I come rushing out in a big hurry.”</p>

<p>“Are you meaning to put a match to the fuse
again?” asked Amos.</p>

<p>“Yes, there is no danger of it’s going off before
we get away; but don’t stop to argue about
it, please. It’s the best thing we can do.”</p>

<p>Accordingly Amos bustled off, and as soon as
he had left the interior of the old windmill structure,
Jack scratched a match. He joined his chum
a few seconds later.</p>

<p>“Now streak it like fun!” he exclaimed, and
the pair started off as fast as they could run.</p>

<p>Jack had figured it all out, and made certain
that they were headed in the right direction.
He did not fancy running slap up against that
trooper returning to see why the bomb failed to
explode.</p>

<p>Having used up about all the time he had figured
on, Jack suddenly drew his companion down
to the ground.</p>

<p>“We’re safe enough here,” he gasped. “Now
watch and see what happens!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[34]</span></p>

<p>He had hardly spoken when there came a tremendous
shock, such as both of them had felt
when a violent burst of thunder followed close on
the heels of a flash of lightning during an electrical
storm.</p>

<p>“Whee!” ejaculated Amos as, looking backward,
<a id="Ref_34"></a>he saw the windmill being hurled skyward
in many fragments.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 476px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">Saw the windmill being hurled skyward in many
fragments.&mdash;<a href="#Ref_34"><em>Page 34.</em></a></p></div>
</div>

<p>They heard the patter of the scattered parts
falling back to earth. Then came a heavy thud
of horse’s hoofs from a point not far distant.</p>

<p>“There, you see he was riding back to make
sure of his work,” said Jack, meaning, of course,
the trooper to whom had been assigned the task
of rendering the windmill useless as a conning
tower for the Allies. “When those Germans get
an order they believe in carrying it out, no matter
the cost.”</p>

<p>“I hope he’s satisfied now,” remarked the second
boy. “It seems that he didn’t glimpse us
running either, which I count a lucky thing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, because he might have chased after us,
and thought it fun to jab us with the sharp tip<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
of that lance he carries,” chuckled Jack. “These
Uhlans make me think of certain Western Indians
I used to meet up with when on the ranch.
For the life of me I can’t understand what use
they make of such an old-fashioned weapon as a
lance in these days of Maxims and modern firearms.
Still, they know what they’re doing.”</p>

<p>“Nothing to keep us from skipping out now, is
there, Jack?”</p>

<p>“Surely not, and we’ll write down the adventure
of the windmill as a stirring memory of
this war business. Come on, Amos.”</p>

<p>“I see you’re heading toward the east, and I
take it you mean to strike that bunch of British
making for the front? Everywhere we go we
keep on asking for information concerning one
Frank Bradford; but so far we don’t seem to
have met with any great good luck. Still, I’m
hoping for the best. With such a chum as you
at my right hand, a fellow would be silly to despair.”</p>

<p>“It’s a long lane that has no turning, remember,”<span class="pagenum">[36]</span>
remarked Jack, as they commenced to walk
along at a smart pace.</p>

<p>“My brother simply told me in one of his short
letters that he had taken that name because it
belonged to our mother, who was a Bradford.
I’m certain it was under it he must have enlisted.
Just how he could get a berth in the British
army, being by birth an American, puzzles me;
but then he may have hoodwinked them about
that; and they were in such need of likely fellows
as Frank, they shut their eyes and took him on.”</p>

<p>So they conversed as they walked along. Half
a mile was soon covered. Jack had learned to
keep his eyes about him constantly. It was the
education of the ranch that caused him to do this
more than any suspicion of threatening peril.
So it came about he again made a discovery that
Amos failed to note.</p>

<p>“Look up, Amos!” he exclaimed, suddenly.</p>

<p>“Why, there’s another aeroplane!” cried the
other, as he obeyed; “two of them in fact, making
three in all. The air is full of the big
dragon-flies, seems like; and Jack, wouldn’t you<span class="pagenum">[37]</span>
say two of them are manœuvring around the
other one that’s built along different lines?”</p>

<p>“Unless I miss my guess,” said Jack, soberly,
“that’s a German machine. They use the Taube
model almost exclusively, as it seems to answer
their purposes. Now, I’ve got a notion that
Taube pilot must have been doing some scouting,
and was trying to make his own lines when he
was cut off by these aeroplanes of the Allies.
Look how they block his efforts to get past, will
you? He rises and falls, but every time one of
the other machines is in the way.”</p>

<p>“There, did you see that puff of smoke from
the German craft?” cried Amos. “Yes, and both
of the others are shooting, too. Why, Jack, just
to think of it; we’re watching a regular battle
in the air between rival monoplanes! Doesn’t it
make your blood tingle to see them manœuvre?”</p>

<p>“The Taube man is getting in hot quarters,
I should say,” observed the ranch boy, as they
stood and stared. “There goes a gun from over
where the British force is advancing; yes, and
listen to the bombardment, would you? They<span class="pagenum">[38]</span>
are firing shrapnel. You can see the white puffs
of smoke where the shells burst.”</p>

<p>“He’s doing his best to get clear, for a fact,
Jack. That pilot is daring enough, and so far
seems to have held his own. Somehow I can’t
help but admire him, even if our sympathies
are with the Allies.”</p>

<p>“A brave man is worth admiring, no matter
on which side he fights,” was the comment of
the second boy; “but there isn’t much chance
he’ll be able to slip by his enemies. They’re too
swift for the Taube man, it seems like. And
when he drops down, those gunners are going to
fairly pelt him with shrapnel.”</p>

<p>“Oh! there he goes with a swoop!” gasped
Amos; “but no, he seems to recover, and holds
his own still. He’s a sure-enough jim-dandy
pilot, let me tell you, Jack! Few bird men could
have done that dip and come up smiling again.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s no need of our standing here
any longer,” observed the other boy. “We can
watch while we walk along. I’d hate to miss
connections with that troop, for somehow or<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
other I keep hoping we may run across a clue
worth while.”</p>

<p>This seemed to suit Amos very well, and they
continued their tramp, keeping up a watch of
the strange fight that was going on far up toward
the fleecy clouds. If either of them stumbled
occasionally on account of the deep interest they
were taking in the wonderful exhibition of skill
and daring being paraded before their eyes it
was not to be wondered at under the circumstances.</p>

<p>The almost incessant roar of the guns, together
with the crash of bursting shrapnel shells far
above them had effectually drowned that dull,
distant sound which from time to time had come
to their ears, being caused by heavy ordnance
battering some fortified place near the coast.
Jack had even suggested that it might be the
British battleships bombarding Zeebrugge, in order
to damage the submarine base the Kaiser
had instituted there.</p>

<p>Twice again did Amos have occasion to declare
he believed the Taube had certainly received its<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>
finishing stroke, for it acted in an eccentric manner,
and seemed to flutter like a wounded eagle
of the skies. When on both occasions he saw
that it recovered in time to elude the swoop of
the Allies’ machines his praise grew louder than
ever.</p>

<p>“I’m almost ready to wish that fellow gets
away scot-free, Jack; he certainly deserves to
win out!” he declared, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“I reckon he’s got something with him he considers
worth fighting for to the last gasp,” remarked
the other; “but every minute this thing
keeps up his chances decrease. He makes me
think of a winded steer tottering along, and so
exhausted that it seems a shame to rope him.
There, that time he must have been badly battered
when the shrapnel burst close alongside!”</p>

<p>“He’s winging down again, all right!” exclaimed
Amos, “and this time it means he’s got
to the end of his rope. His engine has been put
out of commission most likely; and, Jack, see, he’s
heading right at us!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[41]</span></p>

<p>“That’s right!” echoed the other; “and p’raps
we’ll be in at the death, after all!”</p>

<p>The Taube was falling very fast, despite every
effort of the expert pilot to volplane earthward
without the use of his engine. Apparently the
machine must have been badly crippled by the
shower of shrapnel to which it was lately exposed,
and in addition the daring aviator may
have received wounds that prevented him from
properly fulfilling his duties.</p>

<p>As the two boys stood there staring, they saw
the aeroplane sailing lower and lower until it
seemed to be almost skimming the surface of the
earth.</p>

<p>“There! he’s jumped out into that patch of
bushes over yonder!” exclaimed Amos in renewed
excitement, “and the machine has pitched down
further on. He did his level best, Jack, but the
game was too one-sided for him. Wonder is
he living or dead?”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV" class="no-break">CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE TELL-TALE CHART.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Jack noticed that the other two aeroplanes had
withdrawn as though the pilots felt satisfied with
having hurled the Taube to the ground. That
particular section of country was so rough that
they evidently had no intention of trying to effect
a landing. Amos even suggested that possibly
they had not come out of the encounter unscathed,
and that the aviators were glad of a
chance to retire from the battle in the air.</p>

<p>“We must see how badly he is hurt, Amos,”
said the Western boy, as he started toward the
spot where the venturesome birdman had
plunged from his falling machine into the scrub
bushes.</p>

<p>“Yes, I wouldn’t feel right unless we did that,”
agreed Amos, who possessed a tender heart, and
had once upon a time subscribed to the rules<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
governing the conduct of the Boy Scouts of
America.</p>

<p>They were quickly on the spot, and looking to
the right and the left in the endeavor to locate
the stricken aviator.</p>

<p>“There he is, Jack!” said Amos, suddenly,
gripping the arm of his chum as he spoke.
“Down on his hands and knees, too, as if he
might be searching for something he had lost.
Shall we go closer and see if he’s badly hurt?
I think we ought to do what little we can for the
plucky chap.”</p>

<p>Evidently this was what Jack had in mind, for
he immediately started forward. The Taube
pilot heard them coming and looked up. His face
was streaked with blood and dirt, and altogether
he presented a sad picture.</p>

<p>At sight of two boys approaching him instead
of grown men garbed in the khaki of British
soldiers, he seemed astonished. If he had intended
to draw a weapon and sell his life dearly
he changed his mind, for now he was holding
up both hands. To the ranch boy that was an<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>
old and familiar sign of surrender. He had
seen it used on many occasions during his experience
in the West.</p>

<p>“Do you understand English?” was the first
thing Jack asked as he and Amos drew near the
wounded airman, still kneeling there.</p>

<p>The other nodded his head in the affirmative.
He was eying them suspiciously, as though he
could not understand who and what they were,
for English boys were not supposed to form a
part of the army sent across the Channel.</p>

<p>“I haf knowledge of the language if I cannot
speak same much,” he told them.</p>

<p>“Well, first of all, we’re American boys, not
English, you understand. We’re wanting to
look after your wounds, if you care to let us,”
Jack went on to say, at the same time smiling
pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Is it to be a prisoner you mean?” demanded
the birdman, suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Not as far as we’re concerned,” Jack hastened
to assure him. “After we’ve fixed you up you
can go your way for all of us; though you<span class="pagenum">[45]</span>
would do well to hide until night comes along,
before trying to make your own lines. Now,
we’re in something of a hurry, so let’s look you
over.”</p>

<p>He went about doing so with a business-like
air that was convincing. The wrecked air-pilot
may have been loth at first to let mere boys try
to attend to his hurts, but he soon realized his
mistake, and submitted willingly.</p>

<p>There were numerous scratches and small contusions,
but these amounted to little, and, after
being washed with some water Jack carried in
a canteen, could be left to time to heal. The
worst thing was a fractured left arm, which
must have been very painful, though the man
never uttered a groan when Jack dexterously
set the bones and bound it up as best he could.</p>

<p>“That’s all we can do for you just now,” he
told the aviator, after completing the job. “As
one of those other machines might sail over this
way at any minute to see what has become of
you, if you’re wise, you’ll hurry and hide somewhere
so they won’t see you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[46]</span></p>

<p>“I thank you very much,” said the man, evidently
impressed with the kindness shown by the
two American boys.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t mention it,” remarked Amos,
lightly. “We’re supposed to be friends of all
parties to this scrap. I’ve got a German chum
at home I think heaps of, and his name is Herman
Lange. Good-bye, and I want to say you
put up a rattling good fight as long as it lasted.”</p>

<p>Perhaps the other did not wholly understand
all of Amos’ remarks, but he knew the boy was
saying nice things about his recent performance,
so he smiled, and insisted on shaking hands with
them both.</p>

<p>The last they saw of him he was making for
a heavy growth of brush as though intending
to profit by the advice given by the long-headed
Western boy, by lying low until the day was
spent, when it would be safe for him to be abroad.</p>

<p>“For one I’m not sorry I helped ease up that
pain a bit,” remarked Amos, as he and Jack
walked away, once more heading toward the<span class="pagenum">[47]</span>
quarter where they knew the British column
would be found.</p>

<p>“Same here,” echoed the other. “He was a
nervy chap, all right. You noticed that he never
let out a single peep when I shoved those broken
bones together, though I warrant you it must
have hurt like fun.”</p>

<p>“I saw you pick up something and ram it in
your pocket when we were coming away&mdash;must
have been worth your trouble, Jack.”</p>

<p>“It was what the poor chap was hunting for,
I reckon,” replied the second boy, as he thrust a
hand inside his coat, and brought out a roughly
folded paper.</p>

<p>“Why, would you believe it, he’s been making
a regular chart from away up there in the
clouds!” exclaimed Amos, the instant this paper
was unfolded.</p>

<p>“And besides being a bold air-pilot that German
must be a regular topographical engineer
if there is such a thing. I never saw a map
made hurriedly but showing everything so
plainly. Here’s marks to show the positions of<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>
the British trenches around Ypres, every big gun
marked with a cross, and even the supply stations
and the hangars of the aeroplanes plainly
located. Why, with a chart like this, distances
plotted out and all that, German gunners could
shell any position they chose from a distance of
eight or ten miles.”</p>

<p>“A valuable map to fall into the hands of the
Kaiser’s men, eh, Jack?”</p>

<p>“I should say yes, Amos; and that was why he
hated to lose the same after going to all the
trouble he had to make it.”</p>

<p>“Still, it wouldn’t have been just fair for you
to have turned it over to him, because we went
as far as we ought in looking after his wounds,”
suggested Amos.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re supposed to be neutral, though
favoring the Allies, because their aims correspond
with what Americans believe in&mdash;as little
military government as possible. I’m only wondering
whether I had better tear the chart up,
or keep it so as to gain favor with the commander
of the forces over yonder.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[49]</span></p>

<p>“Keep it, Jack; it may open their hearts to us;
you never can tell,” was the way Amos looked
at the matter. So, acting on this advice, the other
boy concluded not to destroy the work of the
chart-maker of the skies.</p>

<p>“There’s one of those other monoplanes starting
up again,” said Amos, pointing.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be surprised if the pilot has been
given orders to drop down and take a look around
where the Taube fell,” Jack continued.</p>

<p>“Little we care,” chuckled Amos, “so long as
he lets us alone. I wouldn’t like to have a
shower of bombs dropped down on me from
overhead. Then didn’t we hear that the Allies
were using some sort of steel arrow with a sharp
point that would go through a German helmet,
and do terrible work? Excuse me from making
the acquaintance of any such contraption at close
quarters.”</p>

<p>They pushed along, now and then casting a
curious glance upward to note what the man in
the aeroplane might be doing. He had not
landed, but made several swoops downward, evidently<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
trying to see what had happened to the
Taube pilot when his machine had smashed to
the ground.</p>

<p>Presently Amos sang out that he could hear
horses neighing, and there were also other signs
of their being close upon a body of troops resting
while on the way to the front. Evidently
there was some sort of fairly decent road near
by, which the artillery and foot soldiers were
utilizing in order to get closer to the trenches
where the British, flanked by the little Belgian
army, held their own against the furious drives
of the desperate Germans.</p>

<p>As they came out from the undergrowth they
discovered before them for a distance of half a
mile or more numerous clumps of men in khaki.
They had started fires and were evidently trying
to heat up something so as to take away their
hunger, as well as warm themselves up, for the
day was a raw and chilly one.</p>

<p>Jack quickly picked out the officers’ mess.
There was no display of swords, no gaudy trimmings
as in the old days when men fought hand<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>
to hand. Bitter experience had shown the British
leaders that in these days of Maxims and
sharpshooters the object of the enemy was
always to mark down those in command, so as to
leave the brigades without officers, and render
them less dangerous in a charge.</p>

<p>“That’s where we want to head,” he told Amos,
as he changed his course slightly. “Unless I’m
away off my base these must be what they call
territorials over in England. They are trained
all right, but have yet to smell their first burnt
powder. If you find your brother at all, it’s
going to be among this class of recruits.”</p>

<p>“They see us and are pointing this way,” remarked
Amos. “I guess they wonder who and
what we are. I’ve fastened that little American
flag to my hat, Jack; it ought to do the business
for us, I should think.”</p>

<p>“Yes, actions speak louder than words they
say, and Old Glory generally carries the respect
of all nations. But between you and me, Amos,
I don’t seem to fancy that commanding officer
any too well. He looks too puffed up with a<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
sense of his own importance. Before he’s been
in the trenches three days he’s apt to get a lot
of that conceit knocked out of him, or perhaps
be punctured by a German bullet.”</p>

<p>“I hope he’ll wear better than he looks,” muttered
Amos, who was feeling very much the same
as his companion did about the appearance of
the stout commanding officer. “There are a
whole lot of questions I’d like to get answered;
a man of so much consequence wouldn’t condescend
to accommodate me, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>They soon arrived at a point where they were
met by a detail of khaki-clad soldiers. To the
non-commissioned officer in charge of these, Jack
addressed himself.</p>

<p>“We want to speak with the colonel in charge
of the column,” he said, simply.</p>

<p>“I have orders to bring you before him, so keep
going right along,” the sergeant told him in
reply, being apparently a brusque man, and, as
Amos said, “without any frills.”</p>

<p>There were fully a dozen officers about the
fire where a hot luncheon was being prepared.<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>
Amos secretly admitted to himself that closer
inspection did not seem to impress him any more
favorably with the colonel. He looked as though
he suspected them from the start of being clever
German spies.</p>

<p>“Well, who are you, and what have you been
doing here so close to the trenches?” he asked
in a disagreeable and harsh voice, frowning at
Jack and Amos, who, however, succeeded in giving
him back look for look, although trying not
to show any signs of impudence, for they knew
it would not profit them any to try and “twist
the lion’s tail.”</p>

<p>“We are both American boys, Colonel,” said
Jack. “If you can spare a few minutes of your
valuable time we will be only too glad to explain
why we are here.”</p>

<p>Those suspicious eyes looked them both over.
Apparently the colonel was not yet convinced
that they were harmless.</p>

<p>“Search them!” he ordered, and the sergeant
who had led them to the spot immediately started
to obey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[54]</span></p>

<p>Of course, as luck would have it, almost the
first article he drew forth and handed over to the
waiting colonel was the wonderfully accurate
chart made by the German Taube man; and loud
exclamations told how the British officers appreciated
the gravity of the find.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_V" class="no-break">CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">STRIKING A CLUB.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Whew! that’s a tough deal, I should say,
Jack!” muttered Amos, evidently somewhat staggered
by this new and alarming situation that
had arisen in their fortunes.</p>

<p>“Keep still,” Jack told him. “Leave it to me.
I will fix it all up in good shape when they give
me half a chance to explain.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the colonel and some of his officers
were discovering new features in connection with
the hastily made map. They could be heard
expressing their wonder at its accuracy. Loudly
did they declare that its possession by the enemy
would be of incalculable injury to the cause of
the Allies, particularly the British forces in Belgium,
and along the French sea coast near Dunkirk
and Calais.</p>

<p>The colonel turned upon the two boys. His<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
frown had become heavier than ever, and that
eagle eye of his seemed to be trying to see all the
way down into their very hearts.</p>

<p>“You claim to be Americans,” he thundered,
shaking his fat forefinger at them; “then how is
it we find this map covering the disposition of
our concealed batteries, supply stations, reserves,
and everything else upon your person? Can you
explain how it comes?”</p>

<p>“Certainly we can, sir,” said Jack promptly.
“I was intending to hand you that chart; indeed,
it was partly to do this we headed directly this
way instead of trying to pass around.”</p>

<p>“It looks very suspicious, you must admit,
boy!” continued the other, shaking the paper
until it rattled. “Which one of you made it?
A clever piece of work, but one that may cost
you dearly.”</p>

<p>“That paper, sir, was dropped by the man in
the Taube when his machine came to the ground,
and he jumped out. We helped bind up his hurts
because he was suffering. Unknown to him I
picked this chart up nearby, where he had been<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
hunting for it as we came up. I suppose he made
the map while hovering over the lines of the
Allies. As you say, it is a smart piece of work,
so we decided that rather than destroy it we
ought to place it in your hands.”</p>

<p>The officer looked at him keenly. He was not
yet wholly convinced, though the air of candor
with which Jack spoke went far toward making
him feel less harshly toward the pair of lads.
Besides, with his own eyes and through his field
glasses he must have witnessed the abrupt descent
of the German machine; and the boys had
certainly come from that direction.</p>

<p>He turned and talked with his officers in low
tones. Some of them seemed to be ready to believe
Jack’s story, while others looked skeptical.</p>

<p>Seeing this, Jack realized that it was time to
make a move on his own account in order to
shift the tide his way. He quietly drew out a
little pocket case of morocco leather in which
he carried several papers that were of especial
value. One, which was already well thumbed,
he selected. The colonel was watching him<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>
curiously, and that gleam of suspicion had not
vanished entirely from his heavy, florid face.</p>

<p>“Would you mind glancing over this paper,
sir?” remarked Jack, apparently in a careless
manner. “It will explain who we are to some
extent. Perhaps the name at the bottom, an old
friend of my chum’s father, may be of interest
to you.”</p>

<p>That magical document had already eased them
over numerous difficulties, and Jack had faith
to believe its usefulness was not yet past. This
is what the colonel of the territorials read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The two boys who bear this letter from
me are under my especial charge. I hope
that all officers in His Majesty’s service in
Belgium, France, or elsewhere will do whatever
they can to assist them to find the person
for whom they are searching, and who
is believed to be in the British ranks serving
under the name of Frank Bradford.</p>

<p class="ir1 p-1">(Signed) “<span class="smcap">Kitchener.</span>”</p></div>

<p>No wonder the officer stared, and then bent
closer to scan that wonderful name again. It
represented the whole hope of the British nation
just then. K. of K., standing for Kitchener of<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>
Khartoum, the hero of the Soudan campaign, as
well as the fighter who had stood shoulder to
shoulder with General Roberts&mdash;“Bobs”&mdash;in
winning the fight for the country of the Boers
in South Africa&mdash;to actually have the head of
the army asking as a personal favor that these
two American lads be treated in a friendly way
was something quite out of the common.</p>

<p>“We win!” whispered Amos, who had been
watching the red face of the consequential officer
steadily as he read the contents of the paper
Jack gave into his charge.</p>

<p>Indeed, a wonderful change had seemingly
taken place in the colonel. Why, he actually
smiled upon them as he handed the paper to one
of his subordinates to read, and then thrust out
his plump hand to Jack. If these lads were in
the good graces of Lord Kitchener it might be
of advantage to any soldier to do them a favor.
Somehow, Amos decided that when he chose to
unbend his dignity the stout colonel was rather
inclined to be a genial sort of man after all.</p>

<p>“I am Colonel Atkins,” he said, affably.<span class="pagenum">[60]</span>
“Would you mind favoring me with your names?
A hint over that signature is as good as an
order to any British soldier. You must forgive
my suspicions. We are in a strange country,
and are compelled to look upon every one as an
enemy until he proves his right to be called a
friend. Those Germans are full of tricks, we
have been told.”</p>

<p>“My name is Jack Maxfield, and that of my
cousin, Amos Turner. His father was a noted
military authority in his day, and somehow became
very friendly with Lord Kitchener, I believe
out in India, or in Egypt, long ago. When we
came across the water on this errand of ours,
the first thing we did was to see K. of K., who
readily gave us this letter, and wished us every
success.”</p>

<p>“As I understand it you are looking for some
one; is that correct?” asked the territorial officer.</p>

<p>“An older brother of my chum, Frank Turner,”
replied Jack. “Some years ago he had an
unfortunate rupture with his father, who is a
martinet in his way, and since then Frank has<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>
been traveling in many corners of the world.
It has now been discovered that the boy was
unjustly accused, and his father is fairly wild to
see him again so as to make amends for the sad
mistake of the past.”</p>

<p>“But what reason have you to suspect that he
may be over here in Belgium where all the fighting
is going on?” questioned the soldier. “There
have been quite a number of Americans enlisted
in a French Foreign Legion, I understand. They
tell me there are scores if not hundreds of them
among the Canadian recruits drilling at Salisbury
Plains over on the other side of the Channel;
but I do not think you will find many actually
in the British army in Flanders.”</p>

<p>“In the first place my brother resembles my
father a great deal,” spoke up Amos, with a
touch of pride in his voice. “He has the soldier
spirit in him; it is bred in the bone, you see. So
I was not at all surprised on getting a few lines
from him telling that he hoped to find a chance
to enlist on the side of the Allies. He was in
London at that time; and as I knew Frank’s<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
determined ways I never doubted but what he
carried his point and joined the army of Kitchener.”</p>

<p>“So much to his credit then,” declared the
other. “If our kin beyond the water really knew
what this war means for the whole English-speaking
world they would give us even more of
their sympathy.”</p>

<p>“You do not want to have us searched further
then, Colonel?” asked Jack, with a gleam of
amusement in his blue eyes.</p>

<p>The portly officer hemmed and hawed a little
to hide his confusion; then he chuckled.</p>

<p>“Oh, I imagine there is no necessity for that,”
he observed, presently. “Anyone who is carrying
a paper signed like this ought to be above
suspicion. You have done us all a service in
securing this valuable chart. If that Taube pilot
escaped, bearing such a document with him, it
would be signing the death warrant for hundreds
of brave boys in khaki before another day had
rolled around.”</p>

<p>“We are heading for the front in the direction<span class="pagenum">[63]</span>
of Ypres. If you are going that way we would
be very glad to accompany you, Colonel,” said
Jack, as he received back the precious document
from one of the officers, carefully folded it again,
and replaced it in his bill book.</p>

<p>“Sorry to say that is not our present destination,
my lad,” replied the colonel. “We are under
orders to take our stand in another part of the
line where stiffening is needed badly. All of us
are eager to get our first taste of the real fighting.
But if we can be of any assistance to you in other
ways you have only to mention the same.”</p>

<p>He had said something aside to one of the
other officers, who walked away to give some
sort of order. Almost immediately a file of soldiers
left the roadside camp and started off across
fields, heading exactly in the direction whence the
two American boys had just come.</p>

<p>Amos saw all this, and believed he could understand
what it meant.</p>

<p>“They’re going to take a look in the brush for
the wounded Taube man,” he told himself. “For
one I hope they don’t run across him. Without<span class="pagenum">[64]</span>
his chart he isn’t so very dangerous. I reckon
the colonel is afraid he may be able to draw a
duplicate of the same from memory. A soldier
takes as few chances as he can of letting the
other side get valuable information. Yes, the
colonel is right, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“The only favor we could ask would be in the
line of making inquiries about the one we’re looking
for,” Jack was saying.</p>

<p>“What name did you tell me he was going
under?” asked the soldier. “I failed to pay much
attention to that in the paper, for my eye had
meanwhile caught the signature below, which
almost took my breath away.”</p>

<p>“My friend’s mother was named Bradford,
and he chances to know his brother was calling
himself Frank Bradford, for reasons of his own.”</p>

<p>Jack had hardly spoken when he saw a look
of sudden eagerness flash over the rosy face of
the Englishman. It gave him a thrill, for he
seemed to feel that it spelled new hope. Even
Amos noticed that lighting up of the colonel’s
eyes, and the uplifting of the heavy eyebrows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[65]</span></p>

<p>“My word! now, that is a remarkable thing!”
they heard him say, half to himself.</p>

<p>“Are we to understand from that, sir, you can
give us a clue that may carry us to him whom
we are so anxious to find?” demanded Jack,
boldly, believing it wise to strike while the iron
was hot.</p>

<p>“I wonder if it could be the same party?” the
officer went on to say. “I was informed his
name was Frank Bradford and that he owned up
to being an American. My word! but this is
remarkable. Tell me, did your brother ever serve
his time as an air-pilot, young fellow?” turning
to Amos.</p>

<p>“Not before he left home,” returned the boy;
“but he was always intensely interested in aeronautics.
If a chance ever came up, I’m sure he
would have made a mighty good birdman.”</p>

<p>“If this is the same Frank Bradford,” muttered
the soldier, shaking his head, “he has already
jumped into the front rank of British
aviators. They censored his name in the newspaper
accounts, but I chanced to hear it from one<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
who had met him on the field. It was after he
made that wonderfully daring trip of seventy
miles up the Rhine country, dropping bombs on
many fortresses by the way, and striking a note
of fear into countless thousands of German
hearts.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I read that story myself, and was thrilled
with it,” cried Amos, excitedly. “Little did I
dream it could have been my own brother Frank
who was the reckless aviator of the Allies. Wait,
I have his picture here with me, taken some years
ago; perhaps your friend may have described
this man to you so that you could recognize him.”</p>

<p>With trembling hands he held up a small photograph
taken with a kodak. The colonel looked
closely. Then he nodded his head in a significant
fashion that made the faithful heart of Amos
Turner beat like a trip-hammer. It seemed as
though by the greatest of good fortune he had
come a step nearer success in his mission.</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum">[67]</span>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI" class="no-break">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">BEHIND THE TRENCHES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Jack, too, had seen from the manner of the
British officer that the kodak picture looked
familiar to him.</p>

<p>“Would you say there was a resemblance between
this face and that of the birdman who
drove his aeroplane through the Rhine country?”
he asked.</p>

<p>The soldier nodded his head again.</p>

<p>“It answers to the description given me,” he
told them. “My informant was very particular
to mention the heavy head of black hair, the
strong look on the face, and the arched eyebrows.
My word! but I really believe you are on the
right track, young fellow. If this Frank Bradford,
who threw the old city of Cologne into a
panic, turns out to be your brother I heartily
congratulate you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[68]</span></p>

<p>Further talk followed. Amos hoped to be able
to pick up more or less information concerning
the present whereabouts of the one he fully believed
must be his brother.</p>

<p>In this endeavor, however, he was doomed to
disappointment, for the officer could give him no
further clue. Whether Frank Bradford still
drove his wonderful machine in the service of
the Allies, or had been brought low during some
later air raid by the gunfire of the Germans he
could not say.</p>

<p>So Jack took it upon himself to change the
subject. He was not as well posted with regard
to the roads of this battle-scarred section of Belgium
as he would like to be.</p>

<p>The colonel, once he had been thawed out by
the sight of that inspiring signature at the bottom
of the letter Amos carried, proved very
affable. It has always been the way with these
icy Britishers&mdash;get behind the reserve they throw
up as they would breastworks, gain their confidence,
and there is nothing they will refuse in
the way of accommodation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[69]</span></p>

<p>So Jack was permitted to look at a map of
the country which the soldier had in his possession.
He even made notes from it which might
serve to assist them on their way to Ypres, that
hotbed of fighting, a salient the Germans seemed
bent on recapturing.</p>

<p>So the two boys finally thanked the colonel,
who heartily wished them all possible success in
their undertaking.</p>

<p>“At the same time,” he told them at parting,
“deep down in my heart I am hoping you may
fail to induce your brother to throw up his job
as one of King George’s boldest fliers. We shall
need all the outside help we can get from our
cousins across the sea, before this bloody business
is over with, for these Germans are born
fighters, every man-jack of them.”</p>

<p>When the two boys had proceeded some distance
along the muddy road, on reaching a slight
rise they stopped for a minute to look back.</p>

<p>Evidently the order to move had been passed
along the line just after they parted from their
new-found friends, for, like a great serpent, the<span class="pagenum">[70]</span>
column of khaki-clad territorials was passing
along the road, a battery of field guns in the van
and another bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>It was an inspiring spectacle. No wonder the
two American boys felt their hearts beat with
aroused sentiments. At the same time Jack
shook his head sadly as he went on to say:</p>

<p>“How many of them will never go back again
to the homes they have left over in old England?
War may seem glorious to those who look on,
but it is terrible. Already we’ve seen some of
the destruction that follows in its track, and I
reckon that before we cross the Atlantic again
we’ll have our fill of its horrors.”</p>

<p>Truer words were never spoken. When Jack
Maxfield said this he meant it only in a general
way. He could not have possibly foreseen what
a wide stretch of territory their search for Frank
Turner would cover, and what amazing scenes
they were fated to gaze upon before the end came.</p>

<p>Once more the chums trudged forward.</p>

<p>Amos was feeling quite “chipper” as he called
it, and there was certainly good cause for this<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>
high hope. They had accidentally run across
what seemed to be a strong clue, and the uncertainty
of the past was being relieved. Jack, on
his part, was figuring out what he might get
through the hands of the censor in his next letter
home. It was Jack’s avowed intention to become
a newspaper man when he entered the business
world, and already he had shown great aptitude
along the line. The descriptions he sent over
to a paper which he had arranged to represent
while abroad were graphic and thrilling. His
pen pictures of conditions as he saw them gave
an accurate view of the situation. Although the
stern military censor might blue pencil all names,
he could not destroy the vivid word painting as
set down by Jack.</p>

<p>Besides this, Jack had contrived a clever little
dodge whereby he hoped to snap off some stirring
pictures. His camera was the smallest ever designed,
but it had an expensive lens, and that
meant more than half the battle.</p>

<p>Jack had it concealed, and so arranged matters
that he could press the bulb and snap off a minute<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
picture without any one being the wiser; and
after being developed this could be enlarged to
any size required.</p>

<p>No doubt, eventually, that clever little contrivance
would get him into what Amos called
a “peck of trouble.” It would doubtless be confiscated,
but Jack hoped he might be able to secure
a series of views well worth working for, ere
that catastrophe came about.</p>

<p>As they walked on, the boys were continually
coming upon fresh works of recent strenuous
warfare. The army of invasion had held stubbornly
to this region, and an unexpected drive
on the part of the reinforced British had carried
the Germans back some five miles or so to where
they had prepared a second line of wonderful
trenches.</p>

<p>Here a stone wall had been used as a breastworks,
as was proven by the devastation caused
by bursting shells. Great holes yawned in the
ground where monsters from the German siege
guns had buried themselves and exploded. And
the boys looked in awe at the piled-up earth, in<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
places marked with small, rudely fashioned
wooden crosses, which told where late combatants
lay side by side, their battle fever forever stilled.</p>

<p>Hardened soldiers might have gazed upon such
things unmoved, but these boys were all unaccustomed
to war’s devastation, and many times their
hearts beat in sympathy with the people they saw
in the desolated cottages by the way.</p>

<p>The afternoon was now wearing away and
it was only natural for the two chums to begin
to wonder where they were fated to pass the
night.</p>

<p>Jack had roughed it many times in the past,
when on the cattle range. He knew what a lone
camp under the stars meant, and could stand exposure
about as well as the next one.</p>

<p>All the same Jack was ready to confess that
if given a choice he much preferred a roof over
his head. The air felt raw and there was even
a chance that a cold rain might set in before
morning, which would be pretty disagreeable all
around.</p>

<p>“I think we’re coming to a village,” he told<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
Amos, who had begun to lag a little as though
leg weary; “or rather what is left of one, for
when the Germans were thrown back they used
every house as a barricade, and before they could
be ejected there would often be hardly one stone
left on another, or a wall standing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you’re right about that, Jack, because I
can see houses ahead of us. I only hope we find
some sort of shelter, and a bite to eat, that’s all.
Jack, don’t you think we’ve made good progress
since sun-up?”</p>

<p>“We’ve done splendidly, for a fact,” the other
readily admitted, “and there’s good reason you
should feel hopeful. On my part I’ve seen and
heard a lot of things today that will make up
the liveliest letter I’ve been able to send across
to the <cite>Times</cite>. On a dozen different accounts I’m
glad I came over with you, Amos; and chief of
all is the fact that I can be of assistance.”</p>

<p>“Why, I never could have gotten on without
you, Jack. You’ve cheered me up when I felt
blue; you’ve shown me how to ride rough-shod
over difficulties; and if ever I do manage to<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
find my brother Frank, nine-tenths of the credit
will lie at your door. You’re the best chum a
fellow could ever have, and that comes straight
from my heart.”</p>

<p>“Well, here we are at the village,” said Jack,
to change the conversation, though he would not
have been human if he had not been touched by
these warm-hearted sentiments on the part of his
cousin.</p>

<p>“And I guess,” remarked Amos, “they must
have pressed the Germans so closely through here
that they had no chance to stop in any numbers,
because you can see the houses are not badly
shattered by shells.”</p>

<p>They found a scene of desolation around them,
however, after they entered the village. Once it
had undoubtedly been a pretty hamlet, but this
was before the rush of hostile armies across Belgium’s
borders.</p>

<p>Fugitives from less favored localities had
sought safety among those who still had roofs
over their heads. Curious eyes followed the boys
as they passed along. Doubtless their coming<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
and their well-fed appearance aroused the wonder
and envy of these hapless people who all
through the storms of the winter season had
fought against starvation and freezing.</p>

<p>Soldiers, rumbling artillery trains, galloping
horses, and all the brave trappings of new levies
going to the front to become food for the cannon
they were accustomed to see day after day.
Then would come the ambulances and motor vans
laden with the groaning victims who were being
taken to field hospitals in the rear of the fighting
line. But when two sturdy lads, one of them
wearing a little American flag in his buttonhole,
walked into their village, the natives became interested
at once.</p>

<p>It was known throughout the length and
breadth of Belgium that charitable America had
fed their suffering millions all through the winter.
On this account any one who claimed to be
a citizen of the generous republic beyond the sea
was welcome in their midst.</p>

<p>So Jack and Amos found smiles upon some of<span class="pagenum">[77]</span>
the wan faces around them as well as wonder
and curiosity.</p>

<p>“If we can only run across some one who
speaks English I’d call it lucky,” Amos was saying
as they reached the center of the village.</p>

<p>“Here comes the man we want to see, then,”
Jack told him. “The rest are pushing him along
as if they knew he could talk with us. My French
isn’t all it should be, and I have to depend on
signs half the time so as to make myself understood.
But it’s going to be all right now.”</p>

<p>Jack proved to be a good prophet, for the old
man with the white beard addressed them in very
fair English. He told them he had worked in
an American arms factory for several years, and
considered that he knew Yankee customs very
well indeed.</p>

<p>“If you wish to spend the night with us,” he
continued, “we will do the best we can to entertain
you. In these sad times most of us are
content to find a roof over our heads, and have
something to satisfy our hunger. I will take
you to my own poor house, though it is already<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
crowded with relatives from other parts of our
distracted country. Such accommodations as we
have you are quite welcome to.”</p>

<p>Of course the boys thanked him, and hastened
to say they would be satisfied to sleep in a shed,
if there was no other place vacant. He asked
them to accompany him, and with quite a procession
tagging at their heels they started off.</p>

<p>It turned out that their host was really an
important man in the village. Jack guessed he
must be the mayor or burgomaster, since every
one seemed to defer to his judgment.</p>

<p>One of the first things they noticed as they
drew near the cottage for which they were
headed, was a small boy parading up and down
bearing a Belgian flag proudly over his shoulder.
He seemed a very determined-looking youngster,
and Amos openly commented on his manifest
patriotism, at which the old man shrugged his
shoulders, and then remarked:</p>

<p>“Of such material are the Belgian people composed.
Like the Dutch they have never been
conquered. They dared even to defy the Kaiser<span class="pagenum">[79]</span>
and his millions of fighting men. Belgium will
rise again, and be a greater nation than ever.”</p>

<p>“And the boy?” said Jack, deeply interested.</p>

<p>“He is a wonderful child, whose brave father,
Jean Larue, my cousin, fell fighting in defense
of Antwerp. Little Jacques dreams of the day
when he may strike a blow in memory of the
father he loved. His mind is full of plans for
trapping the hated Germans, if ever they come
this way again, which Heaven forbid.”</p>

<p>The boy stopped in his military walk to
solemnly return the salute Jack gave him. His
face was unusually grave and they could see that
the horrors of war by which little Jacques had
been surrounded had done much to make him
older than his years.</p>

<p>Everybody tried to be kind to the American
boys, though it was little they could do after
that late pinching winter. But they were given
a small room with a bed in it, which apartment
Jack imagined had been hastily evacuated by
some of the kind old burgomaster’s relatives, now
thrown upon his bounty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[80]</span></p>

<p>“What better could we ask than this?” Amos
wanted to know, as he washed his face and hands
in a convenient tin basin.</p>

<p>“I’m not saying a word,” Jack told him. “Fact
is I reckon we’re in clover, when you think of
those poor ground hogs we saw yesterday wallowing
in the mud of the trenches, and half
frozen at that.”</p>

<p>It was not long before they knew cooking was
going on, and, being a pretty hungry pair of
boys, they exchanged pleased glances as they
sniffed the appetizing odors.</p>

<p>The meal was limited, so far as variety went,
but there seemed an abundance for all. Only
the old burgomaster sat down with them, though
there were a dozen women and children to be
served later on under the hospitable roof.</p>

<p>Upon making inquiry Jack learned that there
was not a single able-bodied man left in the village.</p>

<p>“All them are fighting alongside our beloved
King Albert,” exclaimed the old man, proudly,<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
“or else have already laid down their lives in
defense of their country.”</p>

<p>All these things made a deep impression on
the two American boys. They wondered how
much of the same kind of patriotism would be
found over in their country should an occasion
ever arise when hostile armies occupied the cities
and towns of the republic.</p>

<p>After sitting in their little room for an hour,
where, by the dim light of a taper, Jack wrote
an account of stirring things he had seen that
day, Amos finally begged him to “close up shop”
and go outside a while to take the air before
turning in.</p>

<p>To this Jack offered no objection, for he was
feeling very much that way himself.</p>

<p>The village seemed almost deserted at this
hour, for the night was cloudy as well as raw,
and every one had sought shelter. Even the dogs
answered each other with mournful howls, as
though they, too, partook of the general gloom
that had fallen upon poor Belgium since that day
early in August when the Teuton horde broke<span class="pagenum">[82]</span>
across her neutral territory and began the most
terrible war in all history.</p>

<p>The boys walked out of the quiet village and
along the road for a little distance. It was about
this time that Amos drew the attention of his
chum to something that appeared to have caught
his eye and puzzled him. As usual, Amos depended
on Jack to solve the mystery.</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum">[83]</span>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII" class="no-break">CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE RED LANTERNS IN THE SKY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“I was just wondering if I could be seeing
double, Jack, and if there are two stars as red
as Mars close together,” was what Amos remarked,
after directing the attention of his chum
to a certain spot in the heavens.</p>

<p>Jack gave a low whistle the very moment he
looked.</p>

<p>“I can tell you offhand to begin with,” he
hastily exclaimed, “that those are not what you
seem to think they are, Amos.”</p>

<p>“Oh! is that so?” exclaimed the other. “What
would you say they are?”</p>

<p>“Look closer, Amos, and you can see that they
move.”</p>

<p>“That’s a fact, they do seem to swing like the
pendulum of a clock. Now they’re close together,
and then they separate more. Jack, it must be<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
some sort of flying machine up there; perhaps a
German Zeppelin.”</p>

<p>“I hardly think so,” returned Jack, slowly. “In
the first place no airship would be apt to remain
stationary as those two red lights seem to be
doing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess that’s right,” assented Amos.</p>

<p>“And then again, while the breeze is blowing
softly from the direction of the sea, it’s perfectly
still just now. Only once in a while you can
hear the far-away growl of a big gun. So you
see we’d surely catch the rattle of the propeller
if that were an aeroplane or an airship.”</p>

<p>“Then how would you explain it, Jack?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know for certain, but on a guess I’d
say those red lights might be a couple of small
but powerful lanterns.”</p>

<p>“What! lanterns in the sky?” echoed Amos,
quite staggered.</p>

<p>“Perhaps held up by some sort of big kite,”
continued Jack, “because you can see for yourself
there’s a bully breeze for flying such a thing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[85]</span></p>

<p>“But Jack, whoever bothered with sending up
a kite after dark?” urged Amos.</p>

<p>“I’ve done the thing myself for a lark, and
with a lantern fastened to it to show where it
sailed. Amos, in these war times all sorts of
strange dodges are made use of so as to send
important information.”</p>

<p>This time it was Amos who whistled.</p>

<p>“You’ve certainly got me stirred up in great
shape, Jack,” he admitted. “Who but these
smart German spies would ever think of sending
information through the enemy’s lines by means
of red lanterns attached to a big kite?”</p>

<p>“A clever dodge, all right,” ventured the Western
boy, as they continued to stand there on the
road and watch the colored lights in the heavens
above.</p>

<p>“I wonder what they signify?”</p>

<p>“Those who, far away, are looking through
night glasses must know,” Jack explained. “Two
lights mean a certain fact, and three would carry
a different message.”</p>

<p>“It’s a bold man who would risk his life to do<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>
such a thing,” commented Amos, “for if caught
at it he must expect to meet the usual fate of a
spy&mdash;a file of men, his arms bound, his eyes bandaged,
a rattle of guns, and that would wind up
his career.”</p>

<p>“Still, thousands are taking that chance every
day, in France, England and over in Russia,”
said Jack. “The spy system of the German army
excels by far anything ever dreamed of by other
nations.”</p>

<p>“Of course we’ll never really know the truth
about this business, Jack?”</p>

<p>“I was just wondering whether it might be
possible to find that out, and if we ought to meddle
with matters that are really no concern of
ours,” was what Jack surprised him by saying.</p>

<p>“Do you really think we could run the thing
down, and find the party at the other end of the
kite string?” demanded Amos, at once interested.</p>

<p>“I should say there was a fair chance,” declared
the ranch boy, who figured things out from
force of habit on every occasion. “In the first
place you know that a kite must always go up<span class="pagenum">[87]</span>
directly against the wind. There can be no compromise
about that.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” agreed Amos, already intensely
interested.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s easy to gauge the direction of the
wind, and, after noticing how high the kite must
be, we can figure about how far away the man
would be standing who held the other end of the
cord.”</p>

<p>Jack’s reasoning was so simple and yet so convincing
that the other immediately fell into his
way of thinking.</p>

<p>“Let’s do it, Jack!” he exclaimed enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“I take it you mean to try and look up the kite-flyer,
eh, Amos?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and give him a little scare in the bargain.
That old kite with its red lights has hung up
there long enough.”</p>

<p>“It’s probably fulfilled its mission,” suggested
Jack, “and conveyed the information that it was
planned to send. But I’m curious enough to want
to find out whether my theory was sound or not.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[88]</span></p>

<p>“Then you say go, do you, Jack?”</p>

<p>“Yes, let’s make a start for it,” came the reply.
“In the first place we’ll have to leave the
road and cross this field, because we’ve got to
advance straight into the wind.”</p>

<p>“That’s easy,” said Amos, copying the example
set by his comrade.</p>

<p>“To begin with we’ve got to put a button on
our lips, Amos.”</p>

<p>“I suppose by that you mean we mustn’t talk
any more, eh, Jack?”</p>

<p>“Not unless it’s absolutely necessary, and then
in the lowest of whispers.”</p>

<p>Amos, being a sensible boy, could understand
why there was need of silence, and so he kept
along at the heels of his cousin, using both his
eyes and his ears, but putting a seal on his tongue.</p>

<p>It was not very difficult to cross the field. The
ground proved to be hard enough to keep their
feet from being mired in the mud, and no unsurmountable
obstacles confronted the two boys.</p>

<p>Now and then Jack would pause to take an
observation. At such times he first of all noted<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
the position of the red lights, still in plain evidence
aloft. After that he would make it his
business to closely observe how the wind stood,
and in this way get his bearings afresh.</p>

<p>Amos watched his actions with great interest.
He had picked up a certain amount of woodcraft
knowledge in his association with the scouts, but
Jack, on the other hand, had acquired his through
practical experience. A year or two spent on a
Western cattle ranch is bound to be an education
in itself, and lucky indeed is the boy who can
profit by it.</p>

<p>Presently it became evident to Amos that Jack
was proceeding more carefully. This convinced
him that Jack must believe they were now drawing
close to where the end of the cord that held
the signal kite would be found.</p>

<p>Then Amos also noticed there was some sort
of low elevation beyond. It could hardly be
called a hill, not being high enough for that,
and yet at the same time it was more than a mere
knoll. Out in African Zululand it would possibly
have been called a <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">kopje</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[90]</span></p>

<p>Of course, having himself flown kites many a
time, Amos readily recognized the value of such
an uplift, free from trees as it was, and all other
objects which were likely to become entangled
with the kite string.</p>

<p>Yes, he saw that Jack was bending lower now,
and that he headed in a bee line for that raised
ground. Amos became immediately interested.
Would they make the discovery they anticipated,
once they drew closer?</p>

<p>There was no place in the immediate vicinity
that offered such advantages in the way of elevation
and freedom from interference. And accordingly
it was with considerable faith that
Amos continued to follow close at the heels of
his cousin.</p>

<p>The suspense that ensued was of brief duration.
Then Amos began to follow the dim outlines
marking the rounded summit of the squatty
elevation as seen against the clouded heavens.</p>

<p>Suddenly his eyes stopped traveling along that
curve and remained riveted upon one particular<span class="pagenum">[91]</span>
point. Some object loomed up there, and broke
the even contour of the “hogback.”</p>

<p>“I do believe that must be a man!” Amos was
saying to himself under his breath, while he kept
his eager eyes riveted on the spot; and after
he had followed Jack a little further he was convinced
beyond any possibility of doubt that his
guess had been a correct one, for he plainly saw
the object move.</p>

<p>Well, here was the man supposed to be responsible
for those signals in the sky. Undoubtedly
he must be an exceedingly bold and clever secret
agent of the Kaiser, a spy who had managed to
pick up certain information, valuable from a military
point of view, and was now industriously
engaged in transmitting the same to a German
station miles away. So much was settled. The
question Amos was anxious to have answered
was what Jack meant he and his chum should
do in the matter.</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum">[92]</span>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII" class="no-break">CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE AWAKENING.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Amos!”</p>

<p>That was Jack whispering softly in his ear,
and the one addressed squeezed his chum’s arm
to let him understand that he heard.</p>

<p>“Do you see him up there?”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“We want to creep up as close as we can.”</p>

<p>“Then what?”</p>

<p>“When you hear me begin to yell join in, and
both rush toward him. Get that, do you, Amos?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but he’s sure to break the cord, and let
the kite go.”</p>

<p>“All right. That answers our purpose,” Jack
told him, which certainly was a fact the other had
not considered&mdash;they were not trying to capture
the kite that carried the twin red lights; it would
be sufficient if they could induce the unknown<span class="pagenum">[93]</span>
spy to break the straining cord, and let the airy
fabric bearing the signal lanterns float into space
beyond, to eventually seek the ground.</p>

<p>Once more the boys moved forward.</p>

<p>The base of the low elevation lay before them,
and Jack was now down on his hands and knees
starting to make the ascent. It was beginning
to get real exciting, and Amos felt his heart
thumping heavily against his ribs as he contemplated
the surprise and alarm of the spy when
they started to giving tongue.</p>

<p>As they drew closer they could make out what
he was doing much better than before. He had
something in his hands, which Amos at once
decided must be the stick about which the stout
cord had been wound. That the kite was of fair
size and pulled at times rather strenuously he
judged from the way the unknown used his arms.</p>

<p>Jack seemed to be decidedly clever about this
creeping business. Amos was afraid he could
hardly be put in the same class as his cousin.
He even feared that on several occasions he must<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>
have inadvertently snapped some small twig that
his knees pressed heavily upon.</p>

<p>The sounds seemed almost like thunder notes
to Amos, so keyed up were the boy’s nerves, but
that must have been mostly imagination, for the
man did not appear to have become alarmed by
the sound.</p>

<p>There was no longer the slightest doubt concerning
his occupation, for by now Amos could
see that he certainly clutched some object that
required considerable effort to hold. The kite
probably was very large, Amos decided.</p>

<p>Perhaps the man had already quite enough of
his task, for they could plainly hear him grumbling
to himself, and Amos was sure he caught
low spoken words in unmistakable German.</p>

<p>As seen outlined against the gray sky beyond,
the man appeared to be turned half way around.
Instead of looking toward the quarter where the
kite flew, his attention seemed to be wholly taken
up in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Amos was puzzled to account for this at first,
but he quickly grasped the meaning. Of course,<span class="pagenum">[95]</span>
the spy was looking for some sign that would
tell him his message had been seen and understood
by those for whom it was intended.</p>

<p>Jack’s hand fell on the arm of his chum. Although
no arrangement had been made between
them, Amos guessed that the time was at hand
for the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup</i> his companion had arranged.</p>

<p>Then Jack gave tongue, and his experience on
the cattle ranch in company with a lively set of
cow-punchers had made him a first-class hand at
letting out a fierce whoop.</p>

<p>Amos joined in with what vim he could muster,
so that, taken in all, they managed to create a
pretty respectable disturbance around that region.</p>

<p>It turned out just as Jack had surmised would
be the case. The man who was signalling over
the British lines to his German confederates
immediately dropped the end of the cord connected
with the kite that bore the twin red lights.</p>

<p>Amos, still shouting at the top of his voice,
saw him duck down as though meaning to dodge
any bullets that might be sent in his direction.<span class="pagenum">[96]</span>
After that, the figure of the spy was seen no more
between them and the gray heavens. Judging
from the medley of sounds that came from the
other side of the mound it might be guessed that
the man, either intentionally or through sheer
accident, was rolling headlong down the slope.</p>

<p>Jack stopped yelling, and broke out into a
laugh, in which his cousin naturally joined.</p>

<p>“Look at the kite falling!” the Western boy
called out, and Amos turned just in time to see
the twin red lights before they vanished behind
some trees or other obstruction to his view, dropping
lower all the time.</p>

<p>“We’ve done what we aimed to accomplish,
Jack,” he went on to say, when he could catch
his voice. “After all, it was as easy as falling
off a log.”</p>

<p>“But I’m afraid he had his message up in the
sky, whatever it stood for, long enough to do
its work.”</p>

<p>As Jack said this he clutched hold of the other
and whirled him around again so that his face
was toward the northwest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[97]</span></p>

<p>“That looks like a bursting rocket, as sure as
you live!” exclaimed Amos, as he discovered a
shower of colored stars far away, that seemed
to be floating in space.</p>

<p>“It is just that,” admitted his chum.</p>

<p>“If I was over home I’d guess the Glorious
Fourth had come around, Jack, though it’s generally
considerably hotter than we’ve got it here.
Do you think that rocket’s got anything to do
with this red-fire kite business?”</p>

<p>“A whole lot, I should say, Amos.”</p>

<p>“You mean it was sent up in answer to his
signal?”</p>

<p>“To tell him they saw and understood,” replied
Jack.</p>

<p>“Then our work was for nothing,” grumbled
Amos.</p>

<p>“Oh, I expected that we’d be too late to prevent
the mischief,” the ranch boy admitted. “All
the same, we had the fun of giving the spy a
scare. I reckon he thought a whole regiment of
the hated British was on top of him, by the way
he scooted out of here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[98]</span></p>

<p>“Could you blame him?” demanded Amos.
“Why, if it had been me I think that cowboy
whoop of yours would have given me a cold chill.
I’m pretty sure no German ever heard the equal
of it.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. I take that as a compliment,” returned
the other laughingly. “We’d better get
out of this now.”</p>

<p>“Is there any danger?” asked Amos.</p>

<p>“None that I know of,” Jack told him, “but
you never can tell what these Germans will do.
That fellow may have discovered a trick was
played on him. If he chose to be ugly he might
creep back and open fire on us with his automatic.”</p>

<p>“Whew! standing up here as we are we’d offer
a lovely target, with the sky for a background.
Let’s vamoose the ranch, Jack, as I’ve heard you
say lots of times.”</p>

<p>“I’m agreeable,” the other remarked. “There’s
always a time for ducking even as there is for
an advance. Come along, Amos.”</p>

<p>They hurried down the hill and started over<span class="pagenum">[99]</span>
the field with the intention of striking the road,
so that they might return to the Belgian village.</p>

<p>About half way across, while stumbling along
in the semi-darkness, both boys were suddenly
electrified by seeing a bright flash close at hand,
accompanied by a sharp, spiteful report.</p>

<p>Jack, who had rare presence of mind, and
seemed to know just what to do under any and
all conditions, pulled Amos down to the ground.
As they flattened themselves out into as small a
compass as possible other shots rang out in rapid
succession. The reports came like the quick pulsations
of Amos’ heart under the pressure of
excitement.</p>

<p>When the last shot had sounded Jack started
to his feet, half lifting his companion at the same
time.</p>

<p>“Make for the road full tilt!” he called out,
and with that they commenced to run as fast as
the nature of the ground permitted.</p>

<p>Perhaps Amos wondered whether the unknown
would be satisfied to let them get away. He may
have even anticipated hearing the footfalls of a<span class="pagenum">[100]</span>
pursuer in their rear, and this possibility kept
him keyed up to the top-notch of excitement.</p>

<p>The road proved to be near at hand, and the
running boys managed to reach it without anything
out of the way happening.</p>

<p>In his excitement Amos might possibly have
turned in the wrong direction, but Jack had his
bearings well in hand, and knew what he was
doing.</p>

<p>They did not stop running with their arrival
at the road; in fact, if anything, they increased
their pace. Amos felt willing to keep it up just
as long as his comrade thought best.</p>

<p>Presently they knew the village was at hand,
and accordingly Jack slowed down to a walk.
Both of them were breathing heavily, but Amos
felt that he ought to understand what the plan
of campaign was to be.</p>

<p>“Will you tell the old burgomaster about this
adventure, Jack?” he asked.</p>

<p>“What’s the use?” the other replied. “There
may be other spies around, and we’d only get
ourselves in a peck of trouble. Besides, it<span class="pagenum">[101]</span>
wouldn’t do us any good. We don’t hanker after
publicity. Fact is, in times like these the closer
you draw your head in your shell, like the wise
old tortoise, the better you’re off.”</p>

<p>Amos agreed with him. This was nothing
new, for, as a rule, the boys were of one mind,
though it might be said that Jack played the part
of leader most of the time.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the humble house at which they
were quartered, the boys soon ascended to their
room, being tired, and in sore need of rest. The
village lay there almost in absolute darkness.
Here and there a candle might be burning, but
oil was too scarce a commodity to be recklessly
wasted when all things that were needed to be
done could be accomplished in daylight, which
cost nothing.</p>

<p>Jack had a treasured electric light in his pocket,
a small affair, but which on numberless occasions
he had found very useful. He used it sparingly
because there was scant chance of replenishing
the battery in case it ran out. Flashing it around
the small chamber so that both of them might<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>
become familiar with their surroundings, Jack
presently commenced getting ready for bed.</p>

<p>“I’m only meaning to take my shoes and coat
off,” he told his cousin, “and then pull this cover
over me.”</p>

<p>No doubt Amos thought this sounded a little
suspicious, for he immediately turned on the
other with a question.</p>

<p>“Does that mean you’re half expecting to be
routed out of bed before morning, Jack?”</p>

<p>“Oh, not necessarily,” came the reply, “but I
like to feel that I’m prepared for whatever may
happen. Old habits, you know, picked up on the
range when I served as night wrangler to the
saddle band of horses, and there was danger of
a stampede, a thunderstorm, or visits from cattle
rustlers. Do just as you think best about it,
Amos.”</p>

<p>“What’s good enough for you ought to suit
me,” was the reply Amos made.</p>

<p>They had little trouble in getting asleep. The
day’s arduous tramp had tired Amos in particular,
and though he started to think over the exciting<span class="pagenum">[103]</span>
events that had come their way since dawn,
it was not long before they became a jumble in
his mind, and then gave way to dreams of the
dear ones left at home.</p>

<p>If they awoke at various times during the
night it was only to turn over and go to sleep
again. Young, buoyant natures can easily throw
off mental burdens that might keep older persons
long wakeful.</p>

<p>Hours passed.</p>

<p>It must have been getting well on toward
morning when Amos felt some one tugging at
him. Still half dreaming, he imagined one of his
boy friends must be annoying him while camping
out.</p>

<p>“Let up on that, Billy, and go to sleep again,”
he muttered; but the shaking only increased,
and now some one was calling in his ear:</p>

<p>“Wake up, Amos, wake up I tell you; we’ve
got to get out of this!”</p>

<p>At that Amos threw off the sense of drowsiness,
and somehow managed to understand where
he was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[104]</span></p>

<p>“What’s all that terrible racket, Jack?” he
demanded, as his ears caught a confusion of direful
sounds outside.</p>

<p>“It must be a fierce German drive,” the other
told him. “They are pushing the British back
toward Ypres, and will likely occupy this village
on their way.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum">[105]</span>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX" class="no-break">CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">WHEN THE DRIVE WAS ON.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Amos was already fumbling around for his
shoes. Through the open window came a medley
of sounds, constantly growing in volume. Evidently
a battle was on, and the roar of cannon
began to be deafening.</p>

<p>Outside, the villagers were greatly excited.
They could be seen hurrying this way and that
in the light of breaking dawn. Some were in full
flight heading toward the south, while others
doubtless must be making for underground retreats
in the shape of cellars, the existence of
which they were aware of.</p>

<p>“I can’t seem to find one of my shoes,” complained
Amos. “Just throw that light of yours
around here a second, won’t you, Jack?”</p>

<p>This being done the missing footgear was
located, and soon placed where it belonged.<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
Meanwhile that dreadful noise grew louder and
more terrifying. It was by this time difficult
to converse without shouting. There were stunning
explosions in the air that caused quick
flashes as of lightning. Others made the ground
fairly tremble from the violence of the concussion.</p>

<p>“All ready, Amos?” called Jack presently.</p>

<p>“Give me ten seconds to get my coat on and
I’ll be with you!”</p>

<p>Amos was very much excited, as well he might
be. Never in all his life had he listened to such
a dreadful combination of awful noises. It was
like half a dozen thunder storms rolled into one.
If those Germans believe in carrying on a campaign
of “frightfulness” they were certainly
hewing pretty close to the line right then.</p>

<p>“It’s getting worse all the while, Jack!” he
called out.</p>

<p>“Yes, as more guns come into play,” replied
the other. “This must be one of the drives we’ve
heard so much about.”</p>

<p>“But we said we believed nothing could push<span class="pagenum">[107]</span>
those British chaps out of the trenches they’d
dug themselves into,” said Amos.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how it is,” Jack told him, “but
some way has been found by the Kaiser’s men
to break through. Once that happens, you know,
the whole line of defense crumples up like an
egg shell.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they’re using gas shells,” suggested
Amos, for they had heard some talk along those
lines from soldiers they had met returning
wounded from the front.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t put it past them,” said Jack, “you
know that as chemists the Germans lead the
world. They firmly believe they are fighting for
their existence as a nation. Are you all ready,
Amos?”</p>

<p>Upon the other replying in the affirmative they
left the little room and made their way to the
lower part of the house. Here a single lamp
burned and by its meagre light they discovered
the old burgomaster, who looked more solemn
than ever.</p>

<p>“The Germans must have broken through the<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>
British line of defense, which was only two miles
away from here,” he told them, gravely, “and
I fear it will mean the ruin of all we have left,
for the fighting draws closer all the while, and
they must soon be among the houses.”</p>

<p>“Some of the people have gone away,” Jack
remarked, “and we think we ought to get out,
too, while there is time.”</p>

<p>“Please yourselves, young messieurs, and it is
wise of you, I must say, though if you choose
to remain there is room in the cellar below.”</p>

<p>“Then you mean to stay here and take desperate
chances?” the boy asked.</p>

<p>“It is my duty. I could not forsake my children
when they need my counsel so much. It
may be that cellar shall be our tomb. Nevertheless
some one must remain to watch over the
women and children who cannot get away.”</p>

<p>Amos was greatly affected on hearing the old
man say this. He realized as never before that
heroism is not confined to dashing deeds on the
field of battle. In those days and nights that
tried men’s souls numberless occasions arose<span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
wherein humble individuals, often weak women,
proved their right to the claim of heroism, though
history would never blazon their deeds upon its
pages.</p>

<p>Impulsively Amos seized the honest hand of
the aged burgomaster and squeezed it. He always
considered that he was being honored in
having the privilege of calling him a friend.</p>

<p>“Look, there’s that boy Jacques again, with his
Belgian flag!” called out Jack, pointing to a
small figure that was parading up and down just
outside the window.</p>

<p>“He utterly refuses to join the others in the
cellar,” said the old man, “and he is too nimble
for my infirm limbs to overtake, so I must let
him take his chances. He is wild over the opportunity
to do something to avenge his father,
should the hated men in the spiked helmets reach
here. Alas! I fear poor little Jacques will go to
join his father ere long, when that spirit fills
his heart. Those Germans spare not when the
lust of battle is on them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[110]</span></p>

<p>Jack also shook hands with the old burgomaster
ere leaving.</p>

<p>“I surely hope it may not turn out as badly
as you fear,” he said in parting, after pressing
some money into the other’s unwilling palm.
“The drive will be halted before it reaches your
place. If a chance comes to us we will look you
up again later. Good-bye!”</p>

<p>The old man somehow had taken quite a fancy
to the boys, and it was evident that he disliked
to see them go. He knew what America was
like, and doubtless the peaceful land across the
sea appealed more strongly to him than ever,
now that his own beloved country was being
overrun and ruined by a hostile army.</p>

<p>Once outside the house the boys looked about
them.</p>

<p>It was no longer dark for day was at hand.
Besides, the constant bursting of those countless
enormous shells helped dissipate the gloom, although
in places a low-hanging sea fog made
objects assume a weird appearance.</p>

<p>A few frightened villagers could be seen hurrying<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>
past. Some of them were bearing bundles
as though they had hastily gathered their scanty
possessions together, and intended to cut loose
from their anchorage, seeking safety in hurried
flight.</p>

<p>Indeed, Amos could not blame them when he
listened to all those dreadful noises, and mentally
pictured the desperate scenes that were
likely to occur when the retreating British tried
to make a desperate stand amidst the houses of
the already sorely stricken Belgian village. Perhaps
in the end ere they were driven forth hardly
one stone of those humble dwellings would remain
on another.</p>

<p>As they passed little Jacques, still marching
up and down, Amos patted the child on the shoulder.
There was resolution and courage in the
eyes that looked up at him. Others might be
afraid and tremble and weep, but Jacques was
the child of a soldier. The spirit of Jean Larue,
who fell in defense of Antwerp, dwelt within
that young heart. The coming of the Germans
only meant to poor little Jacques a possible chance<span class="pagenum">[112]</span>
to carry out the plans for revenge that had of
late taken possession of his mind to the exclusion
of everything else.</p>

<p>In leaving the apparently doomed village both
of the American boys were conscious of very
heavy hearts. They had already seen enough of
war’s horrors to impress them deeply. The uncertainty
concerning the fate of all those innocent
non-combatants grieved them exceedingly.</p>

<p>Still, there was absolutely nothing they could
do to render assistance, and for them to linger
there would simply mean unnecessary risk. In
the heat of battle neither one side nor the other
would pay any attention to the fact that they
claimed to be Americans and neutrals. They had
no business on the fighting line, and if injured
could not complain.</p>

<p>Perhaps Jack felt a keen desire to hang around
and see with his own eyes what a desperate battle
looked like. The spirit of the newspaper correspondent
was strong within Jack. But while
reckless at times he could also show considerable
caution. Besides, he was not alone now, he must<span class="pagenum">[113]</span>
remember, and the life of Amos was doubly
precious just then, in the estimation of the one
who had sent him abroad on that search for
Frank Turner.</p>

<p>On this account Jack curbed his desire to
linger and try to see what took place when the
fighting reached the doomed village.</p>

<p>There was little choice in the matter of deciding
upon the direction of their intended flight.
The German drive was coming from the north,
and hence only in the opposite quarter could there
be any assurance of safety.</p>

<p>Fortunately the road offered them an opportunity
to retreat from the village without taking
to the fields.</p>

<p>They quickly overtook a band of villagers
trudging stoically along. During the long months
that had elapsed since the beginning of the cruel
war these poor people had suffered so much that
by now they were growing callous, and accepted
every new trial uncomplainingly.</p>

<p>They had seen beloved kindred shot down, had
watched their possessions given to the torch, and<span class="pagenum">[114]</span>
in so many ways endured the terrors that come
to a subjugated country that it seemed as though
they could weep no more.</p>

<p>Both boys felt for the poor people. They
would have done something to help them, only
there seemed to be no way in which they could
be of any assistance, since it was folly to slow
down their pace to correspond with the snail-like
progress of the fugitives.</p>

<p>All this while the noise to the north had continued
to grow in volume until it was simply
frightful. Amos had never dreamed there could
be as many big guns on the fighting line from
Alsace to the sea as the Germans had brought to
bear upon this one section of the British defense,
possibly only a few miles in extent.</p>

<p>“They boasted that they would batter their
way through to Calais,” Amos called out, as they
stood and listened, “and it looks like they are
doing it.”</p>

<p>“Wait,” said wise Jack. “The fury of the
drive will exhaust itself. Those stubborn British
never know when they are whipped. They will<span class="pagenum">[115]</span>
hang on like bulldogs until the enemy is tired
out, and then block his way with the reinforcements
that must be hurrying up, and which we’ll
soon meet.”</p>

<p>“Then, Jack, you don’t believe the Kaiser will
get to Calais as he said he would, so as to fire
his big guns across the Channel on to English
soil?”</p>

<p>“Not this time, anyway,” asserted Jack. “They
may win three or four miles of muddy ground,
for which they’ll pay a heavy price, but that is
all. Some of those guns you hear crashing are
manned by British Tommies, and Canadian
troops, who are bound to give a good account of
themselves. But the losses will be terrible on
both sides, more the pity. Come, let’s be moving.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum">[116]</span>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_X" class="no-break">CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE CHECK LINE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>They trudged along for a time in silence,
though both of them kept eyes and ears open
so that they might not lose any portion of the
remarkable war panorama by which they were
surrounded.</p>

<p>As they overtook and passed other fugitives
from the threatened village, Amos found himself
still pitying the poor souls once again cast out
upon the cold world.</p>

<p>“I wish we could help them,” he said to his
chum, “but of course that’s out of the question.
We’re like the ‘babes in the woods’ ourselves.
But by now we must be about the end of the
string. The road looks clear ahead.”</p>

<p>“And I was just thinking,” added Jack, “we
hadn’t left the village any too soon for our
health.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[117]</span></p>

<p>He made a suggestive movement with his hand
when saying this, and Amos guessed the meaning.</p>

<p>“Do you really think the battle has reached
there so soon?” he asked as he stood and listened
to the clamor that welled up from their rear.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jack; “from the sound of spattering
rifle firing I think the retreating British have
taken advantage of the houses. Every stone cottage
will shelter a dozen or so. And as the pursuing
Germans come along with a rush they’ll
be met by a murderous fire.”</p>

<p>“Then just as our good old friend the burgomaster
said, it will spell the finish of the village,”
sighed Amos; and apparently his chum caught
his meaning in spite of the dreadful din, for he
went on to follow up the thought.</p>

<p>“Yes, the Germans will turn their guns on the
place if they meet with a set-back there, and
make it a howling wilderness.”</p>

<p>“Those poor women and youngsters,” groaned
Amos.</p>

<p>“It is tough luck,” added Jack, drawing a long<span class="pagenum">[118]</span>
breath, “but only the fortune of war. We’ll see
lots more of it before we’re through, I’m afraid.
But by now it strikes me we ought to be meeting
the first of the British reinforcements coming
forward to fill the gap and stem the retreat.”</p>

<p>“Jack, just as you were saying that I caught a
new sound&mdash;anyhow it came from a new direction.
When there was a little lull in all that
roar of guns I thought I heard the trample of
horses’ hoofs and the rumble of hurrying artillery.”</p>

<p>“You hit the bull’s-eye that time, Amos, for
there they come.”</p>

<p>Both boys felt their hearts beat with a quickened
vigor as around a bend in the Belgian road
came galloping horses drawing a field piece.
After it appeared a caisson with ammunition, and
then other portions of the battery in quick succession.</p>

<p>“Let’s get out of the way, because they’ll need
the whole road,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“But what can one battery do against all those<span class="pagenum">[119]</span>
heavy German guns?” Amos asked, as the leading
horses drew near.</p>

<p>“Oh! this is only a beginning,” he was immediately
told by his companion. “I’ve no doubt
for a mile and more back the road is solid with
them, all hurrying to the front. And tens of
thousands of troops must be headed in the same
direction, though perhaps they’ll take to the
fields, and leave the roads to the artillery. Now
watch, and give the boys a salute as they go
past.”</p>

<p>They stood with their hats in their hands, and
as the first field piece went rumbling by both
boys gave a yell, at the same time waving their
headgear.</p>

<p>The grim-looking gunners returned the cheer.
Their bronzed faces had an eager look, as though
they scented the battle smoke from afar, and
were wild to get busy.</p>

<p>So they kept streaming past, battery after battery,
the officers shouting their commands, for
every one undoubtedly knew exactly where he
was expected to take up a position so as to<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
effectually check the fierce drive that the German
hosts had started.</p>

<p>“There, across the field, you can see them
coming,” called out Jack, after they had waved
their hats until their arms were weary.</p>

<p>“The troops, as sure as anything, and on the
double-quick at that!” exclaimed Amos, again
thrilled by the sight of the khaki-clad legion that
had suddenly burst into view on the full run,
with bayonets gleaming wickedly, and every man
apparently a part of a well-drilled machine.</p>

<p>“Look, look, Jack, there’s a regiment of Highlanders
in their bare legs, tartans and kilts!”
exclaimed Amos. “How fierce they look, Jack!
I don’t wonder that they nearly always carry
everything before them. I’d want to turn tail
and run if I saw those boys heading for me. But
what is the matter with them all that we don’t
hear the bagpipes; and, Jack, where are those
English cheers we’ve heard so much about?”</p>

<p>“Just give them time,” he was told; “they need
all their wind right now for running. When they<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>
strike the line of the Kaiser’s men they’ll do their
shouting.”</p>

<p>“Still they come along, thousands and thousands
of them, as if there was no end to the
reserves. What a splendid lot of men they are.
It’s terrible to think of the homes that will never
see many of them again.”</p>

<p>“Look closer, Amos, for I really believe those
strapping fellows are Canadians!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I can see the maple leaf on that flag,
Jack. And they look as if they could hardly be
kept from whooping it up right now.”</p>

<p>Both boys displayed additional excitement. It
almost seemed as though they might be looking
upon fellow Americans, such is the bond existing
between the two neighboring countries that for
more than a hundred years have lived in amity,
with not even a fort or blockhouse along the three
thousand miles of boundary line.</p>

<p>“I warrant you, Amos, a lot of those fellows
have come from the ranches in the Northwest
Territory. Yes, some of them run as though
they might be more at home on the back of a<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>
horse than afoot. Perhaps I know a number of
the boys, for I spent a time on a Saskatchewan
cattle ranch.”</p>

<p>The thought caused Jack to follow the passage
of the hurrying Canadian regiment with intense
interest. They were, however, too far away for
him to have recognized any familiar faces. Besides,
in the trappings of a soldier a man would
look quite different from the cowboy in sheepskins
or leather “chaps” as Jack had known him.</p>

<p>Finally the rear guard turned up. Long before
the last of the artillery train had passed
by the boys had seen that some of the batteries
left the road a little further on, making for certain
advantageous points where they could commence
to hurl their death-dealing projectiles with
profit.</p>

<p>“Shall we go on again?” asked Amos.</p>

<p>“Yes, because where we happen to be just now
the land is low and flat, and we can see absolutely
nothing,” replied Jack.</p>

<p>“I really believe you’re still hankering to
glimpse the fighting,” Amos ventured to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[123]</span></p>

<p>“I think I know of a good chance,” the other
told him, “and to begin with we’ll leave the road
right here. Follow me, Amos.”</p>

<p>Of course Amos did, for he placed the greatest
confidence in his chum’s judgment.</p>

<p>“Things seem to be going on hotter than ever
all along the line,” he was saying as he kept
alongside the other.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be a terrible day, and the surgeons
of the Red Cross will be kept busy every
minute of the time,” Jack remarked, as they hurried
along.</p>

<p>Amos had noticed that they were not passing
over the fields where the onrushing British reserves
had crossed, since Jack had for some reason
chosen the other side of the road.</p>

<p>As yet Amos had not guessed what his chum
had in view, and when his curiosity had reached
a certain pitch he could hold in no longer.</p>

<p>“What’s the idea, Jack?” he asked.</p>

<p>“There’s some sort of mansion close by, which
has a tower on the roof, and the idea struck me<span class="pagenum">[124]</span>
we might get a bird’s-eye view of what’s going
on if we chose to climb up there.”</p>

<p>“But perhaps the owner might seriously object,
Jack.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let that bother you, Amos,” he was
told. “The great German army stormed through
here on the road to Paris. When it was pushed
back by slow degrees in this section nothing
worth taking was left. If it couldn’t be used up
or carried away to the Rhine country ten chances
to one it was destroyed, so that the enemy
couldn’t have any benefit of it.”</p>

<p>“Then you think this estate is a ruin, do you?”</p>

<p>“You’ll soon see for yourself what happens
when an invading army passes through a hostile
country, for here we are at the place.”</p>

<p>As Jack said this he pointed ahead. Signs of
destruction and vandalism could be seen the very
first thing. The stone fence that surrounded the
property had been thrown down in numerous
places. Even trees had been chopped down to
afford fire wood for the camp, or else because
they were supposed to interfere with the efficiency<span class="pagenum">[125]</span>
of quick-firing guns that at one time had been
planted on the roof or in the tower of the building.</p>

<p>As the boys advanced they were shocked at the
picture of devastation they saw all around them.
Close to the walls of the house all manner of
costly furniture and valuable china ornaments
had been ruthlessly smashed.</p>

<p>“It’s worse than a country fire over in the
States,” remarked Amos. “Why do you suppose
they did this thing?”</p>

<p>“Probably to keep the enemy from getting any
benefit out of all this stuff,” explained Jack, “or
perhaps just to strike terror to the hearts of all
well-to-do Belgians who declined to welcome the
invaders with open arms.”</p>

<p>“But the house is partly wrecked, too, Jack.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you can see it’s been bombarded,” the
other admitted, “and several shells tore holes
right through the walls. One knocked off that
corner; another made this great gap in the
ground when it burst. Limbs were torn from
the trees too. And, taken in all, I’d say it must<span class="pagenum">[126]</span>
have been pretty warm in this section about that
time.”</p>

<p>“Shall we risk climbing up to the tower?”
asked Amos.</p>

<p>“Why not? The house doesn’t look as though
it would crumble and collapse. It would stand
another bombardment, I reckon,” and as he
spoke Jack boldly led the way through the open
doorway.</p>

<p>The interior was a sad wreck. Piles of plaster
lay on the floors, and several rooms looked as
though it might be dangerous to try and pass
through them. Amos glanced this way and that
with something of a shiver. It was as though
he half anticipated making some sort of gruesome
discovery amidst those telltale rubbish
heaps.</p>

<p>Fortunately, nothing of the kind happened, and
after climbing laboriously for a short time the
two boys finally managed to reach the cupola or
tower, where they immediately found themselves
amply repaid for all their trouble with a wonderful
panoramic view.</p>

<span class="pagenum">[127]</span>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI" class="no-break">CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">WATCHING THE BATTLE EBB AND FLOW.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“It was worth all the trouble, Jack,” admitted
Amos.</p>

<p>They could see far away beyond where the
doomed Belgian village undoubtedly lay. Billows
of smoke shrouded most objects, but at
times the wind swept this aside, and at such
moments they could obtain glimpses of the
fighting.</p>

<p>In one place they saw solid masses rushing
forward with the resistless power of might, to
be met with a blast that cut terrible lanes in
their closely packed ranks.</p>

<p>Amos fairly held his breath as he stared. It
seemed almost as though he might be indulging
in a nightmare. Then the powder smoke rolled
like a curtain between, and the view was shut off.</p>

<p>Shells were bursting everywhere, and Jack<span class="pagenum">[128]</span>
soon located the hamlet which they had so recently
quitted.</p>

<p>“They’re at it hammer and tongs around the
village, I’m afraid, Amos,” he called out to his
companion.</p>

<p>“Have you found out where it’s located,
Jack?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you watch sharp when the smoke fog
opens you can glimpse a few of the houses over
that way,” and Jack pointed as he said this.</p>

<p>“Yes, I see it now. And how the shells seem
to be raining down on that spot. I guess the
German gunners have got the range to a fraction.
How d’ye think they manage such things,
Jack?”</p>

<p>“They have the whole country plotted out to
begin with, Amos. And then, you see, they get
tips by wireless right along.”</p>

<p>“Wireless?” echoed Amos.</p>

<p>“In a sense, yes. Look up and you’ll see that
there are a dozen aeroplanes swooping around
like hawks, now fluttering over some particular
spot, and dropping a colored signal paper. That<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>
is to tell the gunners just how to fire so as to hit
what they’re after. Those birdmen have a regular
code they use to talk with.”</p>

<p>“But surely all of them are not German
Taubes, Jack? I can see some that look different
in build.”</p>

<p>“Those belong to the Allies,” Jack declared
with conviction.</p>

<p>“But how is it they chase around, often close
together, without interfering with each other?”</p>

<p>“I suppose that’s because they’re all too busy
now sending information of great value to bother
with their own little rivalry. Though it may be
they take an occasional crack at each other in
passing.”</p>

<p>Amos had conceived a sudden startling
thought, and he watched the evolutions of the
rising and falling aeroplanes with additional interest.
It could easily be noticed, however, that
the machines of the Allies monopolized his attention.</p>

<p>“Oh! I wonder if one of them could be my<span class="pagenum">[130]</span>
brother Frank,” Jack heard him saying presently.</p>

<p>“It’s one chance in ten he’s working up there
right before our eyes,” the Western boy admitted.</p>

<p>After that Amos could hardly tear his eyes
from the darting aeroplanes. When he saw little
puffs of white smoke breaking close to one
of them and knew that this must be shrapnel
shells sent from anti-air craft German guns, his
heart seemed almost in his throat with sudden
anxiety.</p>

<p>“Oh! that would be too cruel!” he exclaimed.
“If I came all the way over here to find my
brother, only to see him shot down before my
very eyes.”</p>

<p>“Don’t think of it,” Jack told him. “Chances
are those are British airmen, and Frank may be
far away from here.”</p>

<p>“Oh! he’s been struck, and is falling!” exclaimed
Amos in sudden terror.</p>

<p>“His machine has been put out of commission,
it seems, but the pilot aims to coast down<span class="pagenum">[131]</span>
so he can land back of his own lines. And as
sure as you live he’s doing it, too.”</p>

<p>They forgot everything else, because of their
intense interest in the fate of the pilot of the
stricken monoplane. A short time later Amos
broke out with half a cheer, such was the excitement
he was laboring under.</p>

<p>“Jack, he’s landed, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>“Reckon he has,” agreed the other.</p>

<p>“And safe behind the British lines.”</p>

<p>“You’re right there, Amos, because the place
where he struck is some distance this side of the
village. That brave fellow is all right, even if
his machine was put out of commission.”</p>

<p>“But the others keep at work right along,
Jack.”</p>

<p>“They direct the gunfire of both sides, to a
considerable extent, and it would be a hard thing
to get along without aeroplanes nowadays. This
war has shown how useful they can be. But
look over yonder. I do believe those are the
British reserves we saw, going into action.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you’re right, Jack, for I glimpsed the<span class="pagenum">[132]</span>
Highlanders deploying behind that stone wall.
And I think that must be the Canadian regiment
charging with their bayonets.”</p>

<p>“It surely is, because I heard their yells when
a shift came in the wind just then. Oh! shucks!
there that smoke has to settle down again and
shut off our view when it was getting so
thrilling.”</p>

<p>“To think that the same kind of fierce fighting
is going on along miles of territory. Do you
think there’s a chance the Germans may break
through at this point, Jack?”</p>

<p>“They may in small detachments while all the
confusion is on, but not in great force,” Jack
replied. “All these things have been anticipated
and prepared for. A battle is like a game of
chess, with every move having a meaning of its
own. The general who can best guess the plan
of the enemy, and lay his own to trip him up, is
the one who’s bound to win.”</p>

<p>It continued to be fascinating work to watch
the stirring events that were transpiring. That
tower on the top of the wrecked country house<span class="pagenum">[133]</span>
proved a splendid lookout for the two deeply interested
boys.</p>

<p>Jack in particular was making it a point to
impress all the features of the action upon his
memory. Later on at the first available chance
he meant to incorporate what he had witnessed
in a stirring letter that might thrill the hearts
of all those in the home land who read it, even
as his own pulses were quickened just then.</p>

<p>When the smoke pall chose to lift again after
quite an interval, Amos gave a cry of mingled
surprise and chagrin.</p>

<p>“Why, Jack, see, they’re gone!”</p>

<p>“You mean the Highlanders who were behind
that stone wall, don’t you, Amos?”</p>

<p>“Yes, not a man of them is left. And, Jack, I
don’t seem to see any stretched out on the
ground. Do you think they had to retreat so
soon?”</p>

<p>“Hardly that,” the other assured him. “Those
Scots are the most stubborn fellows going. They
don’t like to give up anything they’ve once had
possession of. Of course I couldn’t say for certain,<span class="pagenum">[134]</span>
but the chances are they’ve charged out to
meet the oncoming Germans face to face.”</p>

<p>“And they may be bayoneting each other in
that awful fog of smoke further on,” Amos continued.
“Oh! it’s terrible, terrible! I never
thought war was so cruel. I always pictured it
as glorious, with the heroes coming home to be
crowned as victors. I’ll never think of it again
as I used to. General Sherman was right when
he called it what he did.”</p>

<p>So the changes took place rapidly. It was as
though they were looking through a kaleidoscope.
Every puff of air raised the curtain of
smoke in some new section and allowed the absorbed
spectators a chance to look upon phases
of the battle they had as yet failed to see.</p>

<p>To think, that all through that long day, while
the rival armies dug new trenches confronting
each other, this terrible butchery must continue,
was something to chill the heart.</p>

<p>“Why,” burst out Amos at length, after they
had been a long time in the tower, “you could
almost believe the end of the world had come,<span class="pagenum">[135]</span>
with all this noise and fire. They say it won’t
be a flood next time but fire that is going to destroy
everything. For one, Jack, I’m beginning
to get enough of this.”</p>

<p>“We’ll stay only a little while longer, Amos.
Fact is, we’ll never run across such a splendid
chance as this to watch a big battle. It is Teuton
against Anglo-Saxon now, the first time they’ve
been up against each other for centuries really.
And this war will tell which is going to be the
world leaders.”</p>

<p>“If the Kaiser wins we’ll all have to brush up
on our German, and that’s what I don’t like
much,” Amos complained.</p>

<p>“If that was the worst of it there’d be little
reason for complaining,” Jack told him. “I suppose
German is as fine a language as the next,
once you get your tongue adapted to it.”</p>

<p>“I can see a smudge of smoke where we think
the village lies, Jack, and it’s black smoke, too.
Do you think the place has been set afire so as to
drive the British snipers out?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be much surprised, Amos.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[136]</span></p>

<p>“And those poor, poor peasants, the helpless
women and children, what will become of them?”
exclaimed Amos.</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me,” said Jack, with a shiver.
“Those who snatched up what they could get of
their possessions and trekked out along the road
leading to the south were wise, after all.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” continued his chum, “they may suffer
from the cold, but as they get further down into
France they’ll have kind friends raised up for
them on every hand. I wonder will the burgomaster
live through it all, brave old chap that he
was to decide to stay and share the fate of those
who chose to hide in the cellars.”</p>

<p>“And little Jacques,” added the other boy,
“what will happen to him with all those shells
bursting, and the British and Germans fighting
hand to hand in the streets of the village? I’m
afraid the poor little fellow won’t be able to trap
his hated Prussian as easy as he expected.”</p>

<p>Jack turned to observe some feature of the
wonderful panorama disclosed when rifts occurred
in the eddying smoke curtain. It all<span class="pagenum">[137]</span>
seemed to have a decided fascination for him, so
that he would surely regret leaving that eyrie
presently, in order to please his cousin.</p>

<p>Even as he looked, almost holding his breath
with eagerness, there came a strange whining
sound in the air. Something hurtled past not
fifty feet overhead. Then came a terrible crash
that almost knocked both of the boys down, and
caused Amos to cling desperately to the railing
of the cupola lookout.</p>

<p>“That was a shell, Jack!” he gasped, when he
could catch his breath.</p>

<p>“It certainly was,” declared the other. “The
Germans are using this tower as a range finder,
and we had a narrow escape that time.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum">[138]</span>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII" class="no-break">CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">FROM THE CUPOLA LOOKOUT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“I should say it was lucky!” assented Amos,
with an intake of breath; “did you see how it
shattered that tree top when it burst? Looks
like a bolt of lightning had struck it. What
would have happened to both of us if the time
limit of explosion had been just a second less?”</p>

<p>Jack turned and looked away off to where
those billows of white and gray and greenish-colored
smoke hid most of what was taking place
beyond the shifting screen.</p>

<p>“I wonder where it really came from?” he exclaimed,
“and if it was only a random shot, or
did that gunner mean to hit this cupola?”</p>

<p>“Well, I must say you take it mighty cool,
Jack!”</p>

<p>“What’s the use of getting worked up over
it?” demanded the ranch boy, who had learned<span class="pagenum">[139]</span>
long ago how to control his emotions even under
the most trying conditions.</p>

<p>“But they may bombard us again?” expostulated
Amos.</p>

<p>“I give you my word for it, Amos, I won’t wait
for a third invitation to get out. If another shot
comes anywhere near here we’ll go down in a
hurry. But I hardly believe that was intentional.”</p>

<p>Amos, however, was hard to convince.</p>

<p>“Of course they’ve got powerful glasses&mdash;I
mean the officers directing the fire of that battery?”
he ventured.</p>

<p>“That goes without saying, Amos.”</p>

<p>“And if they chanced to look this way they’d
see us here, though of course they couldn’t tell
who or what we were. Now, Jack, wouldn’t it
be natural for them to think some high British
officers had climbed up into this lookout so as to
make use of it as a watch tower?”</p>

<p>“I must say you put up a reasonable argument
there,” admitted Jack.</p>

<p>“Well,” argued Amos, “if they got the notion
in their heads that this deserted chateau was being<span class="pagenum">[140]</span>
used as headquarters by the British commander
and his staff, it would be an object with
the Germans to drop a shower of shells hereabouts,
with the intention of putting them out of
business.”</p>

<p>Jack seemed quite interested in the theory his
chum was so earnestly putting forward. He
even smiled as he turned to look at Amos.</p>

<p>“There’s only one weak place in that argument
of yours,” he went on to say.</p>

<p>“Then tell me what it is, won’t you, Jack?”</p>

<p>“Since that shell dropped in here all of a sudden
I should say two full minutes had gone by,”
the Western boy told him.</p>

<p>“What of that, Jack?”</p>

<p>“Only this, Amos, we’ve seen nothing of a
second shot anywhere near us. There’s been
plenty of time, and to wipe out the British army
staff it would pay to turn the fire of a whole battery
this way; but it hasn’t been done.”</p>

<p>“Then you believe now that shot was only
an accident?” asked Amos.</p>

<p>“Oh! well, some gunner was trying his range,<span class="pagenum">[141]</span>
and got it with just one shell. His next aim was
in another quarter, and it may be he did terrible
work. We’ll never know.”</p>

<p>“But you said you’d be willing to clear out of
this soon, Jack. I wish you’d settle on doing so
now.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I’ll have to keep my word,” agreed
the other, “though between you and me I haven’t
seen half enough of this thrilling picture. It’s
ten times as interesting as looking at one of those
war panoramas like Gettysburg, the Siege of
Paris, and all the rest.”</p>

<p>“And a thousand times more terrible,” added
Amos, “because we know that what we’re looking
at isn’t a painting on canvas but the real
thing.”</p>

<p>“Just give me one more chance to see through
a gap in the smoke,” pleaded Jack. “I’d like
to know what became of those men in the kilts,
and with the bare knees.”</p>

<p>“The Highlanders, you mean,” said Amos.
“Oh! they’ve found shelter behind some other
stone wall, and are holding their own, I’m dead<span class="pagenum">[142]</span>
certain. Just as you said a while ago the canny
Scot keeps a grip on what he can seize like a
bulldog might.”</p>

<p>“Now the breeze has struck up again, Amos,
and it’s blowing the smoke away, like we saw
that fog at sea driven off. Use your eyes and
tell me if you can pick out the men from the
Scotch hills.”</p>

<p>Jack had hardly ceased speaking when his
companion uttered a loud cry, as though he had
made a discovery.</p>

<p>“There they are, flattened out along the
ground, and against that small rise just like so
many cats waiting to pounce on a robin. And,
Jack, see what a distance they’ve gained, will
you?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to predict that the terrible German
drive has reached its limit in this direction,”
said the Western boy, confidently.</p>

<p>“They’re shooting as fast as they can, too,
what at I’m not able to say, for all the smoke.
Somewhere beyond there the enemy lies, and I’m
afraid some of those fellows we can see stretched<span class="pagenum">[143]</span>
out on the ground will never take part in another
battle.”</p>

<p>“But there’s no sign of them retreating, you
notice, Amos. They’re going to stick like leeches.
I reckon in this war German stubbornness is
matched evenly against Scotch persistence, and
English bulldog holding on. What the end of
it all will be I can’t see.”</p>

<p>Amos moved uneasily.</p>

<p>“We oughtn’t to have any great trouble getting
down from here, I should think,” he mentioned,
significantly.</p>

<p>Of course Jack understood the hint. It would
be with only an effort that he could tear himself
away from that wonderful spectacle of modern
man, at war with his neighbors, and bringing
every ingenious device known to latter-day invention
into the conflict.</p>

<p>Left to his own devices and he might have
clung to that elevated watch tower for hours,
impressing on his memory the strange pictures
that were changed with each passing minute.
But he had to consider the wishes of his companion,<span class="pagenum">[144]</span>
and also remember that he had given his
promise.</p>

<p>“No trouble about that, Amos,” he agreed.
“Watch your step when descending.”</p>

<p>“Then you’re ready to come along, Jack?”</p>

<p>“I said I would, so lead the way,” returned the
other.</p>

<p>Amos waited no longer. Perhaps he entertained
a little fear that Jack might change his
mind if he lingered, because of some new and
astounding phase of the furious, long-drawn-out
battle taking place.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he started down the ladder by
means of which they had reached the cupola on
top of the deserted mansion.</p>

<p>Jack waited only to cast one last look along
that front to the north, as if desirous of impressing
the picture upon his mind forever. He had
always possessed a faculty for mental photography
which had been cultivated to the limit, and
which had served him well in times past.</p>

<p>“I’m coming after you, Amos!” he called out,
cheerily, as he started down the ladder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[145]</span></p>

<p>Amos had meanwhile reached the upper floor
of the house. Mechanically he stepped over
some of the broken furniture and fragments of
shattered wall to make for the stairway leading
below.</p>

<p>At the head of this he paused to wait for Jack,
who had just then called out that he was on the
way. So they came together again.</p>

<p>Amos pointed to what seemed to be the remains
of a cradle.</p>

<p>“The people who lived here had children,
that’s sure,” remarked Jack. “I’ve seen toys lying
around, and other things besides.”</p>

<p>“What happened to them, do you suppose?”
asked tender-hearted Amos.</p>

<p>“Oh! the chances are this man fled with his
family when first the war broke out,” Jack declared.
“He was a man of means, and kept his
motor car, because there’s a fine garage in the
yard outside.”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t noticed that, Jack. It certainly is
little that escapes your sharp eyes. But I hope
they got to a safe place.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[146]</span></p>

<p>“Dunkirk and Calais are both really close at
hand,” continued Jack, disregarding the praise
of his cousin, “and there’s no question but this
family found refuge there. Let’s hope he managed
to save his people even if his fine country
place is next door to ruined.”</p>

<p>“Listen! what’s that?” cried Amos, holding up
his hand.</p>

<p>“Galloping horses,” answered the ranch boy,
instantly, for his ears were especially trained
along those lines.</p>

<p>“It must be more British reserves rushing to
the front!” exclaimed Amos, as together he and
his chum headed for the nearest window fronting
the road, which they had no sooner reached
than they discovered a sight that thrilled them.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THE TRAPPED UHLANS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In plain sight, and coming with a rush, though
their horses reeked with sweat and showed
symptoms of great fatigue, was a small detachment
of mounted men.</p>

<p>No wonder the boys stared as though they
hardly dared believe their eyes. This half dozen
hard riders wore spiked helmets, a thing that
seemed to stamp them as Uhlans. They were
coming from the southwest, which fact in itself
was enough to tell the story.</p>

<p>“They’re Germans, Jack!” cried Amos, instantly.</p>

<p>“Yes, a part of some command that broke
through the British lines, and got confused
amidst the smoke, I reckon,” said the Western
boy.</p>

<p>“And, Jack, look, they’re being hotly pursued!”
added Amos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[148]</span></p>

<p>Jack had already guessed as much. He knew
it first from the vigorous way the six riders
were urging their tired mounts on. Then again
he could see how they leaned forward in their
saddles, and turned anxious looks over their
shoulders.</p>

<p>Sure enough there burst into view a second
detachment of riders, whose animals seemed in
better condition for hard service than those of
the fleeing Germans.</p>

<p>These men were garbed in the khaki of British
soldiers. They carried guns which they evidently
knew well how to make good use of even
when riding at headlong speed.</p>

<p>Jack guessed the very second he saw them
ride that those men had not picked up their
knowledge of horsemanship from following the
hounds after the fox in Old Surrey, and wearing
red coats.</p>

<p>Every one of them had been recruited either
from the wilds of South Africa, the cattle ranges
of Canada, or else had served among the Northwest
Mounted Police of the Dominion.</p>

<p>Jack felt like giving a yell of recognition, it<span class="pagenum">[149]</span>
seemed so much like meeting old friends again.
He did nothing of the sort, however, but simply
reached out a hand to draw Amos further back,
because he knew there was no need of attracting
the attention of the hard-pressed and desperate
Uhlans, who might take a notion to send a few
bullets their way.</p>

<p>“What if they stop here and try to make a
fort out of the house?” demanded Amos, as
though he thought he detected a veering to one
side on the part of the fugitives.</p>

<p>“No danger of that,” his chum hurriedly assured
him, “they’re too hot-pressed to halt.
There, see them turn in the saddle and shoot
back.”</p>

<p>“Nothing doing, though,” announced Amos;
“every man jack of the Allies dodged the lead.
And now they’re going to return the fire.
Whew! that was a corking volley, Jack.”</p>

<p><a id="Ref_149"></a>“There goes one poor chap!” cried the Western
boy; “he got his straight.”</p>

<p>A rider had pitched headlong from the saddle,
his horse continuing to gallop alongside its mates<span class="pagenum">[150]</span>
as though nothing had happened. Both boys
were thrilled by witnessing this tragic event that
took place under their very eyes. Until recently
Amos had never known what it meant to touch
elbows with death by violence. He was very
white in the face as he stood there by the ragged
casement, seared by the passage of a shell, and
looked out.</p>

<p>Jack on his part had known more or less of
such events during his ranch life, for things happen
in the “wild and woolly West” where men
live closer to Nature than in the East. Nevertheless,
he too felt the thrill of keen expectancy
as he kept his eager eyes glued upon the actors
in the strange moving panorama.</p>

<p>“There’s another German been hit, Jack; he’s
wobbling in the saddle as if trying his best to
hold on. Perhaps he wants to pick out a soft
spot to fall on. There he goes!”</p>

<p>As Amos uttered these last words a second
saddle was seen to be empty, the stricken man
hurling himself to one side. Even in his dire<span class="pagenum">[151]</span>
extremity he evidently realized the necessity of
avoiding the hoofs of the pursuing horses.</p>

<p>By now the remaining Uhlans had reached the
front of the deserted ruined mansion. They
were following the by-road as the best course to
be pursued, although they could have entertained
next to no hope of ultimate escape.</p>

<p>Bewildered in the smoke, caught in a trap,
they meant to ask for no quarter, but would go
to their deaths like most of their comrades, fighting
to the last gasp.</p>

<p>Jack and Amos could not help admiring their
dauntless courage, even though their hearts beat
more in sympathy for the avowed aims and ambitions
of the Allies.</p>

<p>Swiftly the four hard riders swept by the
broken wall of the chateau grounds. Amos saw
them glance that way. He imagined there was
something like a wistful look on their faces,
tanned by the exposure of a winter to the elements.</p>

<p>“If they only had a little better chance, Jack,
they’d break in here and try to hold the enemy
off,” Amos was saying, as they followed the<span class="pagenum">[152]</span>
passage of the grim determined riders in khaki
along the other side of the broken wall.</p>

<p>Some trees cut off their further view, but their
last glimpse showed them pursued and pursuers
keeping up that headlong pace. So the incident
came to an end. It had been very real and vivid
while it lasted, and Amos, still a bit pallid, turned
to give his chum a serious look, as he shook his
head and remarked:</p>

<p>“They’ll never make it, Jack, with that bunch
hitting up the pace on their heels.”</p>

<p>“Not one chance in ten, I should say,” returned
the other, with the air of certainty that
sprung from a knowledge of hard riding cowboy
tactics.</p>

<p>All signs of the chase had vanished, though
Amos believed he did hear what sounded like
another salvo of shots ringing out. He may
have been mistaken, however, because the air
just then was filled with all manner of strange
noises, from the shouts of charging brigades, the
rattle of distant gunfire, to the harsher throb of<span class="pagenum">[153]</span>
heavy artillery and the incessant bursting of
bombs.</p>

<p>“Fourth of July will seem pretty tame business
to me after all this noise,” Amos remarked, as
he followed his chum back to the top of the stairs
leading to the lower floor of the house.</p>

<p>“I should say it would,” Jack agreed. “I’m
wondering right now what happened to those
two chaps who left their saddles in such a
hurry.”</p>

<p>“The first acted as though he might have gotten
his finish; that’s what struck me, Jack,
though I’m no judge of such terrible things,”
and Amos shivered as he made this admission.</p>

<p>“Yes, I believe he was done for, all right,”
assented the ranch boy, “but it was different with
the second trooper.”</p>

<p>“He picked his dropping-off place,” Amos suggested.</p>

<p>“And threw himself sidelong from his saddle,
first working his feet out of the stirrups,” continued
Jack, showing how his quick eye had taken
note of all these things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[154]</span></p>

<p>They issued forth from the house about this
time, and headed directly for a breach in the wall
that had once served to enclose the grounds belonging
to the rich Belgian’s grounds.</p>

<p>Of course Jack had noticed about where the
second trooper left his saddle. It was just to
one side of the gap which he intended using in
order to gain the little by-road.</p>

<p>“What if we find him injured. Jack&mdash;what
ought we do about it?” asked Amos, about the
time they arrived at the wall.</p>

<p>“Remember the air pilot, don’t you, Amos?
Well, if we could bind up his wounds, and go
our way without betraying him to his enemies,
we ought to repeat, I should think.”</p>

<p>“You know best, Jack, and I want to say that
whatever you settle on doing I’m back of you
every time.”</p>

<p>“I expected you’d talk that way, Amos.
You’d never let an injured dog suffer if you
could help it. Come on, and if that Uhlan can
be assisted through our limited means we’re the
ones to be on the job.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[155]</span></p>

<p>A minute later they entered among the bushes
at the place where they had seen the second
trooper vanish; and almost immediately discovered
the object of their search.</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum">[156]</span>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV" class="no-break">CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">MET ON THE ROAD.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The Uhlan had evidently been trying to hide.
He was crawling along as with an effort, and
undoubtedly experiencing great physical pain in
so doing, which went to prove that his injury
was more than trifling.</p>

<p>He must have heard the approach of the two
American lads, for just as they discovered him
amidst the bushes he drew himself up and faced
about. Amos would never forget that sight of
the wounded rough rider. His face was
scratched and bleeding, doubtless caused by his
hasty and reckless plunge into the bushes at the
time he left his saddle. There was a defiant
look on it, like that of a man who has given up
all hope of coming out of the adventure with his
life, yet meant to show a grim front to the foe,
and go down with colors flying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[157]</span></p>

<p>“Tell him we’re not enemies, Jack!” exclaimed
Amos, quickly, for the sight of that poor injured
fellow gave him a cruel shock; he was reminded
of a wretched dog at bay amidst a host of furious
enemies, and the sensation was anything but
pleasant to the boy.</p>

<p>Jack had just the same notion in his mind.</p>

<p>He held up both hands. This was an Indian
custom which Jack had picked up during his life
in the West. It meant that he did not have arms
in his hands, and that his intentions were pacific.
On the whole face of the earth there are few living
human beings who would fail to understand
the significance of the movement. The Uhlan
was not devoid of ordinary intelligence, even
though sadly rattled just then on account of his
recent heavy fall.</p>

<p>Slowly the two boys advanced. The man was
staring hard at them. He looked as if he feared
it might be only a cunning trick on the part of
these treacherous British, for he undoubtedly
believed they were of that nationality.</p>

<p>“Point to your little American flag, Amos,<span class="pagenum">[158]</span>
while I try to get enough German words together
to let him know where we belong,” said
Jack.</p>

<p>“That’s the ticket,” affirmed the other. “Jack,
be sure and tell him that we stand ready to render
first aid to the injured, if so be he’ll let us
take a look at his hurts.”</p>

<p>The Western boy grunted a little at this. He
did not feel quite so kindly toward the invaders
as Amos seemed to. Jack could not get out of
his mind a whole lot of terrible things that he
had seen with his own eyes, which marked the
ruthless advance of the great German army
through this part of Belgium; and which would
of course be found in the wake of any invading
host. The sack of the fine chateau so close at
hand was only a minute example of what he had
in mind.</p>

<p>Still, Jack knew very well that individually
each German soldier had little responsibility for
such acts. The system back of them must bear
all the blame for the devastation of the land, and
the stern methods of reprisals against such Belgians<span class="pagenum">[159]</span>
as hampered their progress through the
country.</p>

<p>“All right, Amos,” he said, quickly, “I’ll tell
him that; and I reckon we’d feel pretty cheap if
we turned to one side when we might lend a
helping hand. Get busy now, and show that you
are carrying a small edition of Old Glory along
with you over here in these shambles.”</p>

<p>Amos displayed his colors as prominently as
he could by thrusting the lapel of his coat forward,
and pointing energetically at the little flag.
He saw the wondering eyes of the German take
it in; and that he must have partly understood
could be noticed in the expression of surprise
that came upon his face.</p>

<p>Then Jack on his part began to have his say
in the matter. Perhaps his German was pretty
faulty, and at another time might have caused
the man to laugh; but the situation for him was
much too serious just then for anything like
that.</p>

<p>He heard the words “friends&mdash;American boys&mdash;not
your enemies&mdash;would even try to bind up<span class="pagenum">[160]</span>
your hurts after a fashion if you let us!” They
certainly must have given him an intense feeling
of relief, for that strained look on his scratched
and set face gradually relaxed.</p>

<p>He nodded his head and said something in his
own language which Amos believed to be his
readiness to trust the two boys who had so suddenly
appeared before him. Then he sank to
the ground in a heap.</p>

<p>“Jack, he’s gone!” ejaculated Amos, feeling
rather faint himself.</p>

<p>The other sprang forward and bent over the
prostrate Uhlan. Hurriedly he looked the man
over, while Amos waited to hear his decision.
Certainly the poor fellow appeared as though
the “silver cord” had been broken in his case,
for there was no sign of life about him.</p>

<p>“How about it, Jack?” asked Amos, anxiously,
for while he did not know the man from
Adam, at the same time he felt an interest in
him, probably based upon the fact that they had
seen him struck down, and were now at his side.</p>

<p>“He’s only swooned, I think,” Jack told his<span class="pagenum">[161]</span>
chum presently. “You see he’s been pretty seriously
hurt, arm broken, and I’m afraid his ribs
are in bad shape, not to mention the wound he
got from that bullet which has cost him a heap
of blood.”</p>

<p>Jack started at once to try and do what he
could while the man remained unconscious. In
a crude but effective fashion he stanched the flow
of blood. Then he managed to get the man’s
jacket off, and see to his arm, Amos assisting in
setting the broken bone and bandaging the injured
extremity, even sacrificing a part of his
own shirt so as to accomplish this, which was
surely a strong evidence of his earnestness.</p>

<p>“That’s the best we can do,” said Jack, after
they had finished, and he stepped back to look
critically at the work accomplished.</p>

<p>“Will he live, do you think?” asked Amos.</p>

<p>The Western boy shrugged his shoulders and
shook his head.</p>

<p>“I don’t dare say one way or the other,” he
remarked. “If he could get the proper care right
now he’d have a good chance to pull through; but<span class="pagenum">[162]</span>
you know he’s on the wrong side of the fighting
line to expect much. The British will have thousands
of their own wounded to take care of, and
you could hardly expect them to leave even one
of their own flesh and blood behind in order to
make room in an ambulance for an enemy.”</p>

<p>“It’s tough on Hans then, I must say,” and
Amos shook his head in turn, to immediately
add: “But he’s coming to, Jack, for I saw his
eyelids flutter just then.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s beginning to open his eyes,” muttered
the other.</p>

<p>The Uhlan blinked a number of times as he
stared hard at the two strange boys. Evidently
he could not place them at once. Then a wince of
pain made him aware of the fact that he was not
arousing from sleep in his own encampment, and
amidst his comrades. He looked down and saw
the bandaged arm. Possibly something of the
truth flashed across his mind in that instant, for
they saw his face light up, and his eyes were
fastened upon the little American flag in the
buttonhole of Amos’ coat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[163]</span></p>

<p>“We have done all we could for you,” Jack
was trying to convey to him through means of
such words as he could summon up, as well as
various signs with hands, head and shoulders,
such as may be made to mean volumes, “we must
leave you now. Perhaps if you can crawl out to
the edge of the road some Red Cross ambulance
going back with a load of wounded might find
room for you aboard. If you understand what
I am saying nod your head to let us know.”</p>

<p>The man followed his instructions, and Jack
felt after that the limit of their usefulness had
been reached. Humanity could not expect any
more of them, for they had done all that lay in
their power.</p>

<p>“He’s trying to get up, Jack!” exclaimed
Amos.</p>

<p>“Yes, I just told him he’d better crawl nearer
the road, and some ambulance coming from the
front might have room for him. Let’s get one
on either side and help him walk there,” said
the other.</p>

<p>He often wished he could have taken a picture<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>
of Amos and himself assisting the wounded
Uhlan along, just as tenderly as though he were
a brother. It would have always stood for proof
to show that he and his cousin were trying to
carry out the request of President Wilson for
strict neutrality, at least as far as could be done
when brought face to face with the horrors of
the battlefield.</p>

<p>On the border of the little road they stopped.
The German rough rider was propped against a
convenient tree, where any one passing along
could not fail to notice him. They had even seen
to it that his face was turned toward the fighting
line; since any chance of help must come from
that direction.</p>

<p>So they left him there. Amos even turned
once and waved his hand to him, receiving in
return a like salutation; for the Uhlan by that
time could not mistake the friendliness of those
two boys.</p>

<p>“Somehow,” mused Amos as they passed
along, “I’m beginning to think that a whole lot
we’ve heard about the brutality of these Uhlans<span class="pagenum">[165]</span>
is humbug. In the terror and excitement of war
people exaggerate ten times over. Why, that
fellow didn’t look like a savage. His face was
that of a young German, and when the fighting
light died out of his eyes they were as blue as
the skies.”</p>

<p>“I was thinking about the same thing,” admitted
Jack. “Between you and me I’ve got an
idea most of these terrible raiding Uhlans are
at home only ordinary German boys, accustomed
to hard riding. When the call to the colors
came they dropped their ordinary vocation and
hurried to quarters, to put on their uniforms
and take up a new life. In other words, scratch
the back of a fierce Uhlan and after all is said
and done you’ve got a very ordinary citizen of
the Fatherland.”</p>

<p>As they tramped along the road they cast an
occasional glance back toward the ruined mansion
where they had witnessed the terrible battle
between the army of the Kaiser and that of the
Allies; for they fancied that there were Belgian
troops in that line somewhere or other, trying<span class="pagenum">[166]</span>
to keep this corner of their beloved country from
slipping back into the clutches of the foe.</p>

<p>The fight was still going on. At times the
pulsations came in thrilling gushes to their ears,
and then again seemed to temporarily die down.
It was not long before they began to meet vehicles
heading for the fighting zone. These
were not artillery trains now but others bent on
an errand of mercy&mdash;hospital vans, ambulances
perhaps with a doctor and a nurse bearing the
magical Red Cross on their sleeves; English-made
lorries capable of carrying a large number
of groaning warriors to a place where they could
be temporarily looked after, and then probably
sent across to London.</p>

<p>They came in packs, and at times there was a
constant stream in sight. Amos was visibly
moved by all this. He knew that while these
vans were almost empty now, when they returned
they would be carrying loads of suffering
humanity. The boy had had his baptism
along the line of being brought in touch with
war’s dreadful scenes, but he had not as yet commenced<span class="pagenum">[167]</span>
to feel callous, and this wholesale suffering
affected him very much.</p>

<p>Of course all aboard these vehicles intended
for missionary work seemed to be British, saving
possibly a few chauffeurs who may have been
Belgians, able and willing to work in any capacity
so long as they were striking a blow for
the devoted defenders of their sadly harassed
land.</p>

<p>The boys with their cheery faces attracted
considerable attention. Each ambulance carried
a nurse, as well as a doctor when possible, and
these returned the greetings Amos and Jack sent
with their ready hands.</p>

<p>“I suppose it would be pretty nervy in us if
we dared to stop one of them and ask that they
take up our patient on the return trip,” suggested
Amos, still thinking of the wounded
Uhlan propped up against the tree, and with his
wistful face turned down the road.</p>

<p>“I hardly think we ought to mention it,” replied
Jack; “because there’s so much bad blood
shown between the Germans and the British just<span class="pagenum">[168]</span>
now they’d only refuse. This war is getting
more bitter the further it moves along, and
there’s no telling what will happen yet with Turkey
in it, and other nations on the verge of joining
the Allies.”</p>

<p>“There’s an ambulance that seems to be in
trouble, Jack!” exclaimed Amos, pointing down
the road as they turned a sudden bend.</p>

<p>“Yes, something has happened, for the chauffeur
is down, and the nurse also. Let’s quicken
our pace a little more, Amos, and see what’s
gone wrong.”</p>

<p>“We’ve already shown that we’re capable of
helping out in the case of a wounded man,”
chuckled Amos, keeping alongside his cousin as
the latter started off at a faster walk that almost
amounted to a jog trot. “P’raps we’ll also be
Johnny-on-the-spot when it comes to patching up
a bursted tire, or the crippling of some part of
the motor.”</p>

<p>“Well, both of us happen to know a little about
auto motors,” admitted the other, “so that<span class="pagenum">[169]</span>
wouldn’t be so queer, after all. But here we
are.”</p>

<p>“Gee! the nurse is a rosy-cheeked English girl,
all right,” muttered Amos. “If I had the bad
luck to get hurt I guess the sight of her wholesome
face would help me a heap to recover. See
how she smiles and beckons to us, would you,
Jack? She must think we look like we could
help them out of the hole.”</p>

<p>Amos thrust out his chest just a trifle more as
he said this. Really there is nothing that can
awaken a boy’s conceit as much as confidence
expressed in his ability by another, whether this
takes the shape of words or looks.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the spot where the ambulance
stood on one side of the road they quickly learned
what was wrong. After all, it was only a punctured
tire; but while the Belgian boy who had
been at the wheel may have been able to guide
the car, and carry out the duties of a chauffeur
fairly well, he seemed to be something of a sad
bungler when it came to making ordinary repairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[170]</span></p>

<p>Jack instantly realized this when he came up;
and if he had failed to do so the first words of
the pretty English Red Cross nurse would have
convinced him.</p>

<p>“He is making a terrible mess of it, I’m
afraid,” was what she said. “All the chauffeurs
passing are in such great haste to get on I
haven’t been able to secure any assistance. This
boy is green at the work; he was picked up on
the road when the regular driver was taken very
sick and had to be left behind. Would you mind
taking a look, and seeing what needs to be
done?”</p>

<span class="pagenum">[171]</span>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV" class="no-break">CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">WHAT CAME OF A GOOD ACT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“We’ll only be too glad to help, Miss,” said
Amos, quickly, without giving his cousin the first
chance to say anything.</p>

<p>This was a field where possibly he excelled
Jack in proficiency, for he had had more practical
experience with motors than the Western
lad. If it had been anything connected with
horses now, Amos would have known that he
must take a back seat, for the ranch boy was
quite at home along those lines.</p>

<p>For once, Jack was ready and willing to allow
his chum to work while he looked on. He had
seen the nurse staring hard at that small emblem
of the country across the sea which Amos so
proudly carried on his coat lapel.</p>

<p>“You are really and truly Americans?” she
remarked, turning to Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[172]</span></p>

<p>“Oh! yes, we belong over there, and have come
across because we had a very important errand,”
he told her. “We were in England only recently,
and met your Lord Kitchener, to whom we had
a letter of introduction from the father of my
cousin, who used to be great friends with him
long ago out in Egypt or somewhere. He gave
us a paper that is turning out to be a great help in
our search.”</p>

<p>Amos was working busily at the tire, with the
Belgian youth to assist him; but he evidently
heard every word they said, for he turned to nod
his head at this juncture and remark:</p>

<p>“Your K. of K. is the finest gentleman ever,
for he fixed us out, and right now we’re hoping
to be able to find my brother before a great
while. Jack, you explain about it, won’t you,
please, while I knuckle down to this job.”</p>

<p>“Then you are looking for some one who has
been caught over here by the war breaking out?”
suggested the nurse. “There are thousands in
that same trouble. I myself have met many, and
we try to assist them as far as our limited means<span class="pagenum">[173]</span>
will allow. Oh! if there ever was a time when I
wished for a thousand arms it is in these terrible
days and nights. For many weeks each day has
brought new hosts of poor wounded fellows. I
sometimes think the better part of our young
manhood will be cut off if this thing continues
much longer. But you did not answer my question.”</p>

<p>“Well, we are looking for some one,” Jack
admitted, “though he was not caught in Belgium
by the breaking out of the war. On the contrary,
this brother of my chum, who is about
ten years his senior, must have offered his services
to your Government as an experienced
aviator, and was accepted because the supply
of air pilots just then was not equal to the demand.
We have reason to believe he has been
serving in that capacity, and done a few pretty
daring things along his line of scouting and the
like.”</p>

<p>“I have met with dozens of aviators,” she told
him. “In fact, for a time it happened that I
was attached to a corps particularly assigned to<span class="pagenum">[174]</span>
cases of necessity among the pilots of aeroplanes;
for you must know they frequently meet
with serious accidents aside from the dangers
they run while over the enemy’s lines.”</p>

<p>Again did Amos’ head bob up.</p>

<p>“Well, I declare, that’s queer,” he was saying.
“I wonder now if you ever did happen to meet
my brother.”</p>

<p>“What was his name, for you haven’t even
told me yours yet?” the nurse continued, as she
gave the boy one of her smiles.</p>

<p>“My name is Amos Turner, and his is Frank,
but we’ve learned that when he enlisted he went
as Frank Bradford.”</p>

<p>The nurse started, and looked more sharply
at the speaker.</p>

<p>“Frank Bradford, you say?” she remarked,
quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes, and it’s plain to be seen from the way
you act you’ve heard about him,” continued
Amos, his interest growing by leaps and bounds.</p>

<p>“I have even met him,” the Red Cross nurse
announced. “Yes, more than that, it was my<span class="pagenum">[175]</span>
privilege to attend to his trifling hurts after he
had returned from one of his most remarkable
forays over many miles of hostile territory, doing
an immense amount of damage to the German
concentration camps, stores, railway stations,
and Zeppelin hangars.”</p>

<p>Amos colored with pride, for it must be remembered
that it was a Turner, and his own
brother, of whom this praise was being spoken.</p>

<p>“We read accounts of that long flight he made
that left a trail of alarm behind,” said Jack,
“but there was no name mentioned. We only
heard this very day through a British colonel
that it was Frank Bradford.”</p>

<p>Amos left his work for a minute. He was so
excited he felt he must find out a little more
about Frank from the Red Cross attendant.</p>

<p>“How was he injured, Nurse?” he asked.</p>

<p>“The wings of his plane were fairly riddled
with shrapnel,” she explained, “but he had escaped
all that in a miraculous way. In fact, his
only injuries consisted of a few minor hurts on<span class="pagenum">[176]</span>
one of his arms, where he had scraped it in
falling, after he got back into our lines.”</p>

<p>“Was it his left arm?” asked Amos, quickly,
and although the nurse may have possibly
imagined this a foolish question, she answered it
after a second’s thought.</p>

<p>“His left arm&mdash;yes, that’s the one he had injured,
I remember.”</p>

<p>“My brother Frank had some tattoo work on
his forearm,” explained Amos. “It was done by
an old sailor he knew, and whose tales of worldwide
adventure Frank was never tired of hearing.
Can you remember, Nurse, whether the
Frank Bradford you attended was marked with
colored India inks&mdash;he had an eagle stamped
there on his arm, a real screaming American
eagle?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was an eagle, I remember now,” she
affirmed. “He laughed when I told him it was
a shame to allow himself to be mutilated that
way, and said he had dreamed of being a sailor
some day, and visiting every quarter of the globe.<span class="pagenum">[177]</span>
He also told me he had been around pretty
much during the last few years.”</p>

<p>Amos exchanged pleased glances with his
cousin.</p>

<p>“How strange it seems, Jack, that we should
meet two persons in one day who have known
Frank. The tattoo business tells the story good
enough for me; but p’raps I’d better flash that
picture out, and make dead sure.”</p>

<p>When the Red Cross nurse had taken one look
she nodded her head.</p>

<p>“That’s certainly the Frank Bradford I met,”
she told Amos, “though of course he looks older
than in this picture.”</p>

<p>Amos was wearing a broad smile now. It
seemed to him all things must be working together
for their benefit, and that before a great
while he would meet this brother face to face,
when he could tell him how the cloud had been
magically removed from his name at home, and
with what deep anxiety his father was waiting
to welcome him and ask his forgiveness.</p>

<p>“What a lucky thing it was this old tire of<span class="pagenum">[178]</span>
yours had to go down and need fixing, Miss,”
he said, with considerable feeling. “Only for
that we wouldn’t have met you, or learned this
bit of good news.”</p>

<p>“Get busy and finish your job, Amos,” said
Jack. “Time is worth something to many a poor
wounded Tommy Atkins lying out there on the
field, where we saw them falling like ripe grain.”</p>

<p>“That’s a fact,” declared the other, again
dropping down on hands and knees so as
to continue his labors. “I was forgetting that
others are concerned in this business besides myself.
It’s nearly finished, and I think will hold
as good as new. Jack, try and find out if you
can where we’d likely run across Frank about
this time.”</p>

<p>The nurse did not know, in fact she had not
seen the air pilot since that time when she looked
after his hurts, after his return from his long
raid up along the fortified banks of the Rhine
over Cologne and beyond.</p>

<p>“One thing you can depend on,” she did tell
them, “wherever there is most need of a fearless<span class="pagenum">[179]</span>
aviator there you are apt to find him, whether
it happens to be in Flanders, with the French
along the Aisne, far over in the frozen mountain
regions of the Vosges in Alsace, or even
along the Dardanelles, where they have commenced
to batter their way through to Constantinople.”</p>

<p>To hear such words said of his own brother
must have thrilled Amos. He worked away, and
soon arose, saying:</p>

<p>“It’s all done, Miss, and as good as any one
might manage it. I reckon you’ll get along with
that tire for some time now.”</p>

<p>“I wish I knew how to repay you two noble
boys for doing what you have,” the grateful Red
Cross nurse said, with earnestness.</p>

<p>“I think you have more than repaid us as it
is,” declared Jack, “in giving us the news you
did about my chum’s brother.”</p>

<p>Amos looked a little confused, as though he
hardly knew how what he meant to say might
be taken; still he was very set in his ways, and<span class="pagenum">[180]</span>
once he had allowed a thing to get a grip on his
mind he could not be easily discouraged.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I’m bold to mention such a thing,
Miss,” he started to say, “but after we went to
all the trouble to plaster him up, somehow we
seem to take a personal interest in that German.”</p>

<p>“I don’t seem to follow you,” she said, as she
climbed upon the seat of the ambulance again,
alongside the Belgian boy chauffeur who was
ready to once more guide the car of mercy along
its way to the field hospital, where its ghastly
cargo could be taken aboard.</p>

<p>“From the cupola of a chateau that had been
pillaged by the German army,” explained Jack,
“we saw a detachment of Uhlans, that had become
caught back of the British lines, being hotly
pursued by some cavalrymen. Two were shot,
and fell alongside the road. Afterwards we
came on one of them who was badly wounded.”</p>

<p>“You stopped and assisted him, I am sure,”
she said, quickly. “It would be just like such
gallant boys. Besides, this is no affair of yours,<span class="pagenum">[181]</span>
and I can see how German interests appeal partly
to you, even though you may be at heart on the
side of the Allies. What do you want me to do?
Tell me quickly, please.”</p>

<p>Jack described how they had left the poor
wounded Uhlan near the mansion she was sure
to notice on the way to the field hospital for a
load of the wounded.</p>

<p>“On the way back,” said Amos, “if by any
means you can crowd just one more in your ambulance,
will you take him along? I ask this
favor partly because he is our patient, and our
professional interest has been aroused.”</p>

<p>The earnestness of the two boys had its influence
upon the English nurse.</p>

<p>“I promise you to do the best I can,” she told
them, as she gave Jack and then Amos her little
hand in parting. “It is partly because I am more
than curious to see if you are as much at home in
binding up the wounds of men as you seem to be
at making a punctured tire whole. Good-bye!
The best of luck follow your efforts to find your
brother Frank. If I see him I shall surely tell<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>
him that you have come all the way over here
from your land of peace to discover him.”</p>

<p>The ambulance went hurrying along the road,
and the two boys had no idea they would ever
see the red-cheeked English nurse again. They
felt that they had been repaid ten times over because
of the little trouble taken to relieve those in
trouble.</p>

<p>“It certainly beats the Dutch how things turn
out,” Amos was saying as they once more started
to trudge along, with their backs for the most
part toward the region where the big guns
growled, and the tumult of battle was borne to
their ears from time to time with the rising and
falling of the wind.</p>

<p>“We’ve got little to complain of, for a fact,”
added Jack. “It all goes to prove that a good
act is never thrown away. We didn’t expect
to be rewarded in any way when we stopped to
patch up that tire; yet see how it came out.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Amos, earnestly, “after this I’ll
never doubt that old saying, for it’s been proved
over and over again. But I’d give a heap to<span class="pagenum">[183]</span>
know whether Frank was one of those air pilots
we saw wheeling and dodging about when the
battle was going on. And Jack, the scent is
getting warmer all the time. We’ll find Frank
yet!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI" class="no-break">CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">FIGURING IT ALL OUT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>If other reinforcements were hurrying up to
take their places on the firing line, the boys did
not happen to meet them on this road. It seemed
to be given over almost entirely to vehicles of
every description speeding forward to carry off
the bleeding forms of those whose lives might
yet be saved.</p>

<p>There were some queer-looking vans among
the rest, for every available motorcar had been
pressed into the service of removing the injured
to Dunkirk and Calais, where later on they
could be transported to Havre and across the
Channel.</p>

<p>“I was just wondering,” Amos remarked after
some time had elapsed, “why both Germans and
the Allies seem to set so great a store on the
holding of Ypres. From all the information<span class="pagenum">[185]</span>
I’ve been able to pick up, as a place it doesn’t
amount to a row of beans. And yet, Brussels,
Antwerp and a whole lot of other cities fell without
one-quarter of the fighting that’s been taking
place around here. How do you make it
out, Jack?”</p>

<p>“The only thing I can see,” replied the other,
“is that it must be a railroad center, and from
Ypres there’s a good road to Dunkirk and
Calais. You know how set the Kaiser has been
right along on getting his big guns stationed
on the French coast, where the Channel is only
twenty miles across. He’ll never be happy until
he can watch one of those monsters hurling
shells that fall on England’s shore.”</p>

<p>“And the British are just as bent on keeping
him from doing it, seems like,” observed Amos.
“Queer how a little thing like that brings about
many desperate fights. Tens of thousands of
Germans have been killed, wounded or captured
just because of a pet whim of the Kaiser’s; for
I don’t believe anything very great would come
of it even if they did take Calais. The British<span class="pagenum">[186]</span>
battleships would pour in such a smashing
amount of shells that they’d wreck any gun emplacement
the Germans might build.”</p>

<p>“It’s a queer war all around, I think,” said
Jack. “It started with a match in the powder
magazine, when that murder occurred in Servia;
and by degrees it’s getting to be the most terrible
thing that ever happened on this old earth,
barring none. We’re living in wonderful times,
Amos.”</p>

<p>“Seems so, Jack, when you stop to think of all
that’s being done, in the air with dirigibles and
aeroplanes, and under the sea with the submarines.”</p>

<p>“Our fathers laughed at Jules Verne when
they read some of his books,” ventured the other
boy, seriously; “but let me tell you most of what
he described there has already come to pass. We
may live to see his account beaten to a frazzle,
as Teddy says, the way things are going on
nowadays.”</p>

<p>“It’s a blessed good thing that America’s three
thousand miles away, and that the whole big<span class="pagenum">[187]</span>
Atlantic Ocean rolls between,” remarked Amos,
reflectively.</p>

<p>“By which you mean we’re not likely to get
into this scrap, I take it,” said his cousin. “Just
go a little slow there, my boy.”</p>

<p>Amos stopped short to look at him in wonder
and uneasiness.</p>

<p>“Whatever do you mean, Jack?” he started to
say. “From the way you speak it looks as if you
wouldn’t be a bit surprised to see the United
States get mixed up in this awful business, after
all.”</p>

<p>“Which would be what I meant,” explained
Jack, soberly, “much as I hate to admit it. Stop
and think for a minute, no matter how much the
main body of Americans may want to keep out,
remember that we’ve got some six millions of
Germans who are supposed to be naturalized
citizens, but whose hearts still beat fondly for
the Fatherland. Besides, there might be a whole
lot of reasons why Germany would really want
to see war declared between herself and our
country.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[188]</span></p>

<p>“Why, they must be crazy to want that, Jack!
We have a hundred million people, and could do
them all sorts of harm.”</p>

<p>“Could we?” asked Jack, shrewdly. “In what
way, I want to know? As there isn’t any vessel
today carrying food or anything else from
America to Germany they wouldn’t feel it there.
We wouldn’t send an army over, nor yet our
battleships to take chances of being torpedoed.
We might send forty or eighty torpedo boats
and destroyers, but that is all. Can’t you see
that if our country were at war it would shut off
the great supply of arms and ammunition that
is flowing across to Great Britain and Russia
and France? We’d need it all at home for six
months.”</p>

<p>Amos stared as well he might. He had not
bothered looking below the surface when he figured
that war with the United States would mean
the overwhelming of the Teutonic race. It took
Jack to consider what lay underneath the exterior,
and see signs of a deep game wonderfully
played by the Kaiser’s Strategy Board.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[189]</span></p>

<p>“If that ever happens,” reflected Amos, “it’s
bound to be a world war in fact, and every nation
going will be drawn into it. But after Turkey
I don’t know of even one country that stands
back of Germany and Austria. That alone
makes it seem as if they must be in the wrong;
but of course no German will admit that, even
if ten thousand neutrals were against him.</p>

<p>“You remember the obstinate Irishman on the
jury that disagreed, who claimed that there were
‘eleven pig-headed men’ locked up with him, the
most stubborn lot he had ever run across?”
laughed Amos.</p>

<p>“One thing sure,” Jack added, “if Germany is
beaten in the end it’ll only be the same way our
South was whipped, by sheer force of superior
numbers, wearing them away until they have to
hoist the white flag and surrender. Great Britain
is already fighting on that policy of Grant’s,
that man for man the Allies can stand equal
losses better than their enemies.”</p>

<p>“Why, I’ve been beaten at checkers by the
same dodge, Jack. The other fellow having<span class="pagenum">[190]</span>
managed to get one of my men by some accident
insisted in facing others and compelling an equal
exchange, till it got down to his having two to
my one; which odds proved too much for me.
I’ve quit playing the game on that account.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going to predict that the chances
are Germany, if she ever does quit, will do it
from the same reason, that as the war goes on
the ratio against her will keep on increasing
steadily until she is overwhelmed. Perhaps Holland
will be dragged into it, and the Allied army
will pass through the Netherlands to invade Germany
from the west. We may live to see the
end, and I want you to remember what I’m saying.”</p>

<p>So they talked as they went on, not as careless
boys, but with the air of observers deeply impressed
by what they had witnessed of the great
war. Rubbing up against such impressive sights
is bound to be a great educator, and those two
wideawake American boys had progressed by
great leaps and bounds since coming abroad a
short time before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[191]</span></p>

<p>“Is that smoke rolling overhead, or clouds,
Jack?” asked Amos, a short time later, as he
chanced to look up.</p>

<p>“Clouds, because they are coming from another
quarter than the fighting line,” the experienced
Western boy announced.</p>

<p>“Then perhaps we’ll get some rain before long,
though it feels pretty cold for that, when you
come to think of it,” replied Amos.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t surprise me if we did,” said Jack.
“They say that after a big battle it nearly always
does rain, whether from the great noise,
or something else I can’t tell you. If it comes it
means more mud, and goodness knows we’ve had
enough of that before now.”</p>

<p>“If only it’s heavy enough it may put a stop
to the fighting for today, which would mean
some lives saved,” ventured the other.</p>

<p>“Only to be sacrificed tomorrow, so what difference
does that make?” Jack returned. “I’m
getting kind of cynical about these things. There
will be just so many men killed in this war, you
see, and so the sooner they reach that number<span class="pagenum">[192]</span>
the better. Then perhaps America can patch
up an enduring peace.”</p>

<p>“Jack, I really felt a big drop of rain then!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m afraid we’re in for a storm that
may last the rest of this day, Amos.”</p>

<p>“And no shelter in sight,” groaned the second
boy. “I wish we could only run across another
ruined chateau like that one we visited this morning.
It might seem a little hard to go hungry
all night, but we could build a fire, and keep
comfortable anyhow, and that’d count for a lot.”</p>

<p>“Let’s start out and run for it,” suggested
Jack.</p>

<p>“What’s the use, if we have to get soaked anyway?
See here, Jack, have you glimpsed any
haven of refuge? Is there a cottage in sight, a
friendly cave, or even a big hollow tree into
which we might push?”</p>

<p>Jack laughed at the way his cousin said this.</p>

<p>“I think I sighted something like a cottage
ahead of us, several of them in fact,” he admitted.
“If that was a fact, why, we may be coming<span class="pagenum">[193]</span>
to the outskirts of the town of Ypres, which isn’t
a very big place.”</p>

<p>At that Amos looked pleased.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! who knows but what we may get
something to eat in the bargain, even if sour
black bread is all they’ve got to spare. I can
run faster than this, if you say the word, Jack!”</p>

<p>“Then whoop it up for keeps!” Jack told him,
immediately setting a good example by increasing
his own pace.</p>

<p>There were houses ahead. The drops began
to come down faster, and it seemed to be an open
question as to whether Jack and his cousin would
reach shelter fairly dry or not until the rain
had drenched them. Almost winded with their
exertions, they presently arrived in the midst
of the cottages, which like nearly all others in
Belgium of that day showed positive signs of
having been under artillery fire.</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum">[194]</span>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII" class="no-break">CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">SHELTER FROM THE STORM.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“We’re going to make the push, Jack!” gasped
Amos, as they found themselves in close touch
with the cottages.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I only hope we’ll find a friendly
roof to shelter us,” added his chum.</p>

<p>The clouds hung heavy above them. One
would almost imagine the day was far spent, and
night about to close the curtains of darkness
around them. Again did they feel drops of rain
starting to fall, and this time it threatened to
continue.</p>

<p>Looking around, Jack picked out a certain
house as the most promising of all those near by.
He never could exactly explain just why he selected
that particular cottage, except that it was
possibly a bit closer than any other, and the rain
began to fall more and more heavily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[195]</span></p>

<p>Hurrying under the shelter of the little porch
that lay before the door, the boys found that they
could immediately escape the increasing downpour.
At the same time, as this was no mere
summer shower, Jack did not intend to stay on
the outside.</p>

<p>So he proceeded to knock with his knuckles on
the closed door. There was no immediate reply,
at which Amos suggested that possibly the cottage
might be without a tenant.</p>

<p>“If you looked a little closer,” his comrade told
him, “you’d never say that, for there is smoke
coming from the top of the chimney. Besides,
I saw a face at the window staring at us when
we rushed under this little canopy that shields
the door.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say!” ejaculated Amos.</p>

<p>“It was the face of an old woman, and white
with fear I thought,” continued Jack, seriously.
“Still, that shouldn’t surprise us, because in
these terrible war-times all sorts of frightful
things are constantly happening to make timid
people shiver with dread.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[196]</span></p>

<p>“But, Jack, surely two boys oughtn’t to make
anybody afraid?” expostulated Amos.</p>

<p>“Sometimes the most innocent-looking things
are the most dangerous,” his chum told him.
“These poor Belgians must be seeing German
secret agents everywhere about them. We have
been suspected before now, and seen in this
strange light even you might appear a regular
ogre in her eyes.”</p>

<p>“But, my stars! Jack, are we going to stay out
in the rain right along just because some silly
person might think all strangers are German
spies? Don’t you intend to knock again?”</p>

<p>For answer Jack once again brought his
knuckles against the door with more vim than
before. It might even be considered a knock of
authority, for there is such a thing.</p>

<p>This time they plainly heard the shuffling of
feet within. Then a bar seemed to be removed,
which in itself was a mute evidence of the radical
change that had come to this land since war
stalked abroad; for in the good old days of peace<span class="pagenum">[197]</span>
it was likely that no door had ever been fastened,
since thievery was next to unknown.</p>

<p>As the door was partly opened they saw a man
of middle age, whose sight was confined to one
eye. He looked plainly worried, Amos could
see; but being content to leave all matters to Jack,
he held his peace.</p>

<p>It was the usual habit of the boys when desiring
to communicate with any of the people whom
they chanced to meet to test them first of all with
English. There were a certain number of Belgians
who could speak that language, having
picked it up in trade, or by reason of having
been across the Channel working in English factories
during dull seasons in their own country.</p>

<p>Jack first of all pointed to that wonderful little
flag which Amos bore in his buttonhole.</p>

<p>“We are Americans&mdash;from the United States&mdash;can
you talk English?”</p>

<p>He saw the man’s face give a twitch, and even
fancied that his worried face took on a partially
relieved expression, though his hand resting
upon the edge of the door still quivered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[198]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I can speak and understand English,”
he immediately said in a quavering tone. “Both
the wife and me, we have worked over in Birmingham
in the days that are gone. What is it
you want, m’sieu?”</p>

<p>Jack waved his hand as if to call his attention
to the descending rain.</p>

<p>“Shelter from the storm,” he said. “We will
be only too glad to take whatever accommodations
you can spare, so long as we keep our coats
dry, and get a bite to eat; and please understand
we will pay for the service. I hope you will not
refuse to accommodate us for one night, my
friend!”</p>

<p>The old man looked puzzled. He acted as
though while he would like to say no, policy compelled
him to think twice before committing himself.</p>

<p>“Please wait a minute. I will talk with the
good wife.”</p>

<p>He closed the door in their faces as he said
this, softly, however, as though not wishing to
offend them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[199]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I like that,” said Amos. “We may have
to go elsewhere to get out of the rain.”</p>

<p>“Give them a little time,” cautioned Jack.
“It shows that the woman rules here, as she
usually does in every home. Don’t you remember
that story about the man who started out
to learn whether the man or the woman of the
house was the actual boss, and found to his
satisfaction that it was always the lady?”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember hearing it, Jack,” commented
Amos. “Suppose you tell me about it
while we’re waiting for them to decide this
matter.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I thought it was a chestnut,” laughed
Jack. “It’s so good that it would bear repeating
anyway. This man started out to please his
father, taking ten chickens in the wagon and a
pair of horses, one gray and the other a roan.
If he found that the woman bossed the house
he was to leave a fowl; and should he ever come
across a home where the man was absolutely
the ruler one of the horses was to be given to
the happy couple!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[200]</span></p>

<p>“That’s interesting. Honest, Jack, I’ve never
heard the story before, either.”</p>

<p>“From house to house the man went. In every
case he learned that woman ruled the ranch, and
so by degrees his supply of fowls got down to a
single specimen. Then he came to a place where
there was a big burly man and a small sharp-eyed
wife. When he stated his case he learned
that in this home the man did just as he pleased.
Both declared this, and it looked as though he
had at last hit on an ideal couple, which would
please his father very much.</p>

<p>“‘Since in this house the man is the sole boss,’
he told them, ‘I am empowered by my father to
make you a present of a horse. Now choose
which one of these two animals you would want
to have.’</p>

<p>“‘The gray one strikes me as just about right,’
said the man.</p>

<p>“‘It’s a good horse,’ admitted the woman, ‘but
don’t you think the roan a little the finer, John?
It seems to me if there is any choice I’d take the
roan.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[201]</span></p>

<p>“At that the man told them to step aside and
settle the matter; so after some talk the husband
came forward a little sheepishly and said:</p>

<p>“‘Mister, if it’s all the same to you I think
we’ll take the roan horse!’</p>

<p>“‘You’ll take a hen,’ said the traveler, as he
chucked the last fowl out of the wagon, and
drove back to tell his father that woman was
supreme in every home.”</p>

<p>Amos laughed heartily at hearing the conclusion.
Anxieties do not wholly suppress young
blood, which is capable of throwing cares aside
at will.</p>

<p>“Here they come to the door again,” he told
Amos. “I wonder what they think of hearing
me laugh so loud.”</p>

<p>This time the door was thrown wide open by
the man.</p>

<p>“Enter, young messieurs. We will do the best
we can to entertain you. But after such a terrible
winter it is little any Belgian family possesses
to keep body and soul together. Lucky
are those who still have a roof over their heads.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[202]</span></p>

<p>The old woman looked at them, and nodded
her head as both boys saluted her respectfully.
They were given chairs, and seemed glad to sit
down to rest, being more or less tired after
walking.</p>

<p>“What a wonderful day this has been for us,
taken in all,” Amos was saying as they looked
out of the small window and saw how steadily
the rain was coming down.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to mark it with a white stone in
our log of this trip abroad to the battlefields of
the world war,” Jack asserted.</p>

<p>“Do you think they mean to keep us over
night?” asked Amos, in a low tone, as he noted
that both man and woman seemed to be stirring
around, getting the fire started afresh, as though
meaning to do some cooking.</p>

<p>“Oh! yes, he said as much as that,” Jack replied.
“There’s an upstairs to the house, and
perhaps some sort of loft where we can lie down
to sleep. But it’s a poor family, remember. So
don’t expect too much of them.”</p>

<p>“I’m willing to put up with almost anything,”<span class="pagenum">[203]</span>
hastily observed Amos. “But do you notice how
often they glance this way, and then if they see
either of us looking, seem confused? Jack, it
isn’t curiosity that makes them act so, but something
more in the line of fear.”</p>

<p>“They may have a notion that after all we’re
German spies, and meaning to get secret evidence
that will bring them under the military ban later
on. So, while we are here we must be careful
not to say or do the least thing to add to their
anxious feeling. Let our talk be wholly of
America, and of how she feels for the wrongs
of poor Belgium.”</p>

<p>Once there was a knock at the door which
produced the greatest consternation on the part
of both the old man and his better half. He
finally answered the summons, and seemed
greatly relieved when he found it was only a
neighbor who may have seen the two boys go
in and felt desirous of knowing who and what
they were.</p>

<p>So the dull afternoon wore on to a close. The
housewife busied herself over her fire, and the<span class="pagenum">[204]</span>
old man talked with the boys. He seemed to
grow a little easier in his mind the more he heard
them tell about the land beyond the ocean. It
was as if some of his secret fears may have been
set at rest.</p>

<p>While the supplies of food may have run
pretty low in that humble Belgian home, as was
the universal case, still the housewife knew how
to get the most out of what she had. The appetizing
odors that floated to the boys began to
make them anxious for the summons to sit down
at the table.</p>

<p>Presently this came, and they were not at all
surprised to find that the old couple were deeply
religious, and asked a grace before partaking of
the meal. Even the worried look forsook the
face of the good wife when the two uninvited
guests chatted pleasantly, and told of many interesting
things in connection with America, the
wonder land to most peasants in the Old World,
and of which they can never hear quite enough.</p>

<p>So the meal was ended, and the boys again resumed
their seats by the window. It had grown<span class="pagenum">[205]</span>
dark by now, with the rain still coming down,
though fitfully.</p>

<p>“I really believe it may let up before long,
don’t you, Jack?” Amos ventured to say, as they
sat there, watching the two belonging to the cottage
busying themselves with various duties, and
every once in a while get their heads close together
to exchange confidences, as though some
weighty secret lay between them.</p>

<p>“The signs point that way,” replied Jack, who
was always watching out for a change in the
wind, or anything else that might indicate possible
weather conditions in the near future.</p>

<p>“I certainly hope we have a decent day tomorrow,”
said Amos. “To think of all those poor
fellows lying wounded and uncared for on the
battlefield, how they will suffer tonight in this
cold rain. It makes me feel sick just to remember
it. No matter whether they are British, Belgians,
French or Germans, they are our fellow
human beings, and have been our friends.”</p>

<p>The old man did not come over to them for
some little time. Jack fancied that he was getting<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>
nervous again, for several times he
half started from his seat and looked quickly
toward the door.</p>

<p>Sitting there for a while, the boys found that
they were getting very sleepy. Jack purposely
yawned several times when he thought the owner
of the cottage was looking their way. If this
was intended as a gentle hint it finally met with
its reward, for the man came towards them.</p>

<p>“Young messieurs,” he said, awkwardly, “if
you are tired and would lie down I will show
you the best we can do for you. It is not much,
but you will understand that no one can be expected
to do more in these terrible times.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t say that again,” Amos burst
out with in his impetuous fashion. “You are
doing us a great favor as it is in giving us shelter
from the rain, and something to eat. We
feel grateful. I could sleep on a board and be
thankful for the privilege.”</p>

<p>The man took a candle and started up the
steep stairs that seemed almost like a ladder,
with the two lads following after. They found<span class="pagenum">[207]</span>
themselves in what appeared to be an unfinished
loft. The rain could be heard beating softly
on the roof. On the bare floor was a thick
feather mattress, and some bedclothes, as well as
two pillows.</p>

<p>“That looks good to me,” remarked Amos, immediately.</p>

<p>“It is the best we can do,” said the peasant, as
he set the candle down, and bowing humbly
backed toward the stairs, letting down the trap
after he had vanished.</p>

<p>“Why, we’ve got the whole upper part of the
place to ourselves,” observed Amos, as he looked
curiously about him. “Seems like our attic at
home, come to think of it. Only I certainly hope
there are not so many rats prowling around as
we’ve had to fight there. I’d hate to have one
nibble at my nose while I slumbered so sweetly
on that bouncing feather bed.”</p>

<p>“I suppose they have a small sleeping-place
downstairs,” remarked Jack, reflectively. “I
wonder why they didn’t put us in there instead
of up here. Not that I object to this, for it’s<span class="pagenum">[208]</span>
just fine; and that patter of the rain on the roof
will lull us to sleep, I reckon. Still, I suppose
they didn’t want to bother with us down there;
or they may have had some other good reason.”</p>

<p>“For one I want to forget everything but that
I’m as sleepy as they make them,” and by the
way Amos yawned as he said this there could be
no doubt that he meant every word of it.</p>

<p>They took off only their shoes and coats, for
it was quite cool in the room under the roof.</p>

<p>“Last in bed puts out the candle!” chuckled
Amos, as he crawled under the covers.</p>

<p>Jack performed this ceremony, and followed
the other. He could not help noticing that little
streamers of faint light managed to find their
way up from below in certain places. This told
him there were cracks in the floor of the loft, a
fact that did not surprise him in the least.</p>

<p>Amos was as good as his boast, it seemed.
He had said he would be fast asleep about as
soon as his head struck the pillow. It was not
long before Jack knew from his even breathing
that he had fulfilled his threat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[209]</span></p>

<p>Jack somehow seemed to lose his drowsy feeling
after lying down, as often happens to some
persons, so that they are inclined to take the first
nap sitting in a chair. He found his mind becoming
more active than he liked. It seemed as
though all kinds of things began to flit through
his brain, including the mystery surrounding the
old couple downstairs.</p>

<p>Becoming annoyed after he had lain there for
nearly an hour with closed eyes, and yet no
nearer going to sleep than in the beginning, Jack
took himself sternly to task, and determined to
forget all outside happenings.</p>

<p>His resolution was immediately sorely tried,
for had any one been gifted with the eyes of a
cat, capable of seeing in the dark, he might have
discovered Jack actually sitting up as though
listening.</p>

<p>Had Amos awakened just then he might have
asked his chum if he thought he heard the
squeak of a foraging rat. But Jack seemed interested
enough to quietly crawl out from under
the covers and silently make his way along to<span class="pagenum">[210]</span>
where the largest crack in the floor was to be
found.</p>

<p>A short time afterward he was shaking Amos
gently, and whispering in his ear.</p>

<p>“Wake up, Amos, and don’t give a peep,” was
what he said in the lowest tone possible. “There’s
something queer going on downstairs. A man
has come in; they opened and closed the door as
softly as they could. They are talking together
after dropping the bar at the door. I’m afraid
these people are either not Belgians or else secretly
in league with the enemy. I plainly heard
a word in German!”</p>

<span class="pagenum">[211]</span>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVIII" class="no-break">CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THROUGH A CRACK IN THE FLOOR.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Amos was no longer sleepy; indeed, the boy
had never been more wideawake in all the course
of his life. What his cousin had just whispered
in his ear was enough to thrill him through and
through.</p>

<p>“Can I see, too?” he asked eagerly, as though
it would gratify him very much if able to satisfy
his curiosity in this regard.</p>

<p>“Yes, but creep along softly, and be careful,”
he was instructed by Jack.</p>

<p>Accordingly Amos began to move along after
Jack, who led him directly to the spot where he
had found the widest crack. Presently both boys
were flat on their stomachs, and with their eyes
glued to the slender aperture.</p>

<p>Apparently Amos had no trouble about seeing,
for before long he drew back again. The murmur<span class="pagenum">[212]</span>
of low voices came up to them from below,
and he had found that it was just as Jack said.</p>

<p>A young man had come in, and was talking
very earnestly with the old people. Whatever
it was engrossed their attention they glanced suspiciously
about them from time to time. Amos,
looking further, had seen that the bar was again
across the door, and also that every little window
was carefully covered with some sort of
dark material that would prevent prying eyes
from peering through into the room.</p>

<p>That some of the conversation had a connection
with the two lads was evidenced from the
way the man pointed upward more than once.
Amos, too, believed he caught a German word
spoken by one of the conspirators below.</p>

<p>Was this a secret spy, and if so had that apparently
harmless old couple been bribed by German
gold to betray the cause of their country?
It was a dreadful thought, and made Amos feel
as cold as ice; for like most American boys he
had a perfect horror of treachery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[213]</span></p>

<p>“Jack!” he whispered softly, touching the
other with his groping hand.</p>

<p>“Yes, what is it?” asked his comrade in the
same cautious way, though the patter of the still
falling rain on the nearby roof would very likely
have drowned what little noise their voices made.</p>

<p>“It looks bad, don’t you think?” asked Amos,
as though eager to have his own view confirmed
by the opinion of his partner.</p>

<p>“It certainly does, I’m afraid,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“They act like they are plotting with that
stranger,” suggested Amos.</p>

<p>It was just what Jack had been telling himself.
In fact, the actions of the old couple could be
set down as mighty suspicious. All the while
they talked in those low tones they were looking
toward the barred door, and then up in the direction
of the loft, just as guilty persons might
be expected to do.</p>

<p>Of course, in those trying times, for a Belgian
to be caught having secret connection
with the enemy was equivalent to signing his
own death warrant, for there would be little<span class="pagenum">[214]</span>
mercy shown, no matter how old and infirm he
or she chanced to be. If, therefore, this couple
were treading on this dangerous ground, their
confusion and nervousness when the boys asked
lodging could be readily understood; they had
expected a visit from the spy, and were afraid
that the so-called Americans might learn of his
presence.</p>

<p>Jack was puzzled to know what might be the
right course for them to pursue under such extraordinary
conditions. He felt sorry for that
old couple. Necessity might have forced them
to accept a bribe and betray their own kind.</p>

<p>Then again the idea of treachery was so repellent
that the boy could find no palliation for
the dastardly crime. A spy may be a brave man,
taking his life in his hand in order to gain secret
information that will improve the chances of the
cause he advocates; a traitor is a sneak who, for
gain, turns on his best friend.</p>

<p>Accordingly Jack hardened his heart against
that old couple. They had appealed to his sympathy
on account of their age and apparent infirmity;<span class="pagenum">[215]</span>
but even that must not be used as a
cloak to defend their base conduct. Many lives
of brave fighting men among the Allies might
be lost through the information they were even
now confiding to that heavy-set young German
spy.</p>

<p>Jack again lay flat so as to watch, and Amos
copied his example. It was not easy to ask questions
and hear the answers; so that perhaps he
could gather up more information by using his
own eyes.</p>

<p>Apparently those below were more than ever
alarmed over the possibility of interruption from
some source. Even as the two boys in the loft
overhead renewed their eavesdropping tactics
they saw that the old man had pressed a finger
on his lips as though he would entail silence on
the other two.</p>

<p>After that he glided over and carefully lifted
the table that stood in one part of the apartment,
and which was different from the larger one at
which they had partaken of that evening meal
some time before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[216]</span></p>

<p>Amos, seeing what he was doing, glued his eye
more eagerly than ever to the crevice, not wishing
to lose a single thing. He watched the old
man cast aside a piece of rag carpet that had
covered this section of floor. Then to the surprise
of the boys he lifted a regular trap in the
floor, disclosing a dark aperture.</p>

<p>Why, it was just like one of those old-time
stories Amos could remember reading, that pertained
to haunted mansions, traps in the floor,
secret chambers, and passages, and even tunnels
leading out from the cellars underneath. The
boy could almost believe he must be dreaming,
and yet, as he put out his hand and felt Jack
alongside, he knew it was the real thing.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly they meant that the spy should
hide there, for some reason or other. The old
woman had a bundle in her hand that might
contain food, Amos concluded, and this she
turned over to the stranger. Whoever the party
was he did not seem at all averse to vanishing in
those black depths; in fact, Amos considered that
he acted as though only too willing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[217]</span></p>

<p>There must have been some sort of ladder
leading downward, for they could see him descending.
Then the woman ran over and, snatching
up the candle from the shelf, held it as
though more or less solicitous that the other
might not slip and lose his footing on the rounds
of the ladder.</p>

<p>The boys saw the unknown flip his hand upwards
just before he was utterly lost to sight in
the gloom that lay heavy down under the trap.
Then the old man lifted the section of flooring
and allowed it to fall back into place again,
though careful that it made no perceptible sound
while so doing.</p>

<p>After that the strip of rag carpet was carefully
replaced, and on top of that he lifted the
table. All was as innocent looking as before,
and no one not in the secret would ever suspect
that down underneath the cottage floor lay a
strange secret and which had all the earmarks
of treachery to the cause of the Allies.</p>

<p>The old man and his wife now moved to the
other end of the room. They were talking it<span class="pagenum">[218]</span>
all over in soft tones, and Amos could see that
apparently the man tried to encourage his better
half, for he seemed to be assuring her that what
they were doing was for the best.</p>

<p>Amos, lying there a prey to varied thoughts,
was sorry for them. He actually believed that
the temptation must have been too much for
their standard of loyalty to their sorely stricken
country. With the gold they would receive for
this work perhaps they meant to go to America,
there to build a new home amidst strangers, and
forget if they could the land they had betrayed.</p>

<p>“Oh! it’s too cruel, and I can hardly believe
any one would be so mean as to do such a thing,”
Amos was saying to himself, as though trying his
best to find a gleam of comfort.</p>

<p>Jack, pulling at his arm, aroused him.</p>

<p>“Let’s get back to the mattress, and talk it
over,” the Western boy said in his ear, and at
that they both began to move softly along, Jack
apparently having a thorough knowledge of the
attic, as though he had made a mental map of<span class="pagenum">[219]</span>
his surroundings at the time the candle still
burned.</p>

<p>Once again they stretched themselves out
there. If a board creaked under their weight,
as they moved so cautiously, it could easily have
been mistaken for a gust of wind outside whining
around the corners of the cottage.</p>

<p>Amos was eager to hear from his chum. He
placed such an exaggerated value upon Jack’s
opinions that in this emergency he wanted to
learn what the other thought about it, what their
course should be, and all other things along
similar lines.</p>

<p>“Do you still think that he must be a spy,
Jack?” he asked, to get a start made.</p>

<p>“I can’t see anything else so far,” replied the
other. “Their fear of being interrupted seemed
to say as much. Then the several words spoken
in plain German make that stronger. It must be
the man is afraid to go out again, which was
why they’ve hidden him down in the cellar.”</p>

<p>“P’raps what information they mean to give
him isn’t quite complete yet, and he’ll have to<span class="pagenum">[220]</span>
stay over until the next night?” suggested Amos.</p>

<p>“That isn’t a bad idea,” commented the ranch
boy, soberly.</p>

<p>“But, Jack, what ought we do about it?” asked
Amos. “’Course this isn’t any funeral of ours.
We’re neutrals; but I hate a traitor so much I
feel like setting my heel on one as I would on a
viper. If these silly old people have gone and
sold themselves for German gold, they ought to
be punished for it. That’s what I think, Jack;
now tell me if you’re of the same mind,” and
Amos stopped whispering to give his chum a
chance to speak.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIX" class="no-break">CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">JACK DEMANDS THE TRUTH.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Jack hesitated a short time before replying.
It was plain that he hardly knew just what their
proper course should be, and wanted to be sure
he was right before attempting to sway his companion.</p>

<p>What Amos had said must have had an influence
upon him, because as American-born boys
they nearly always felt alike in such matters.
Yes, they meant to be as neutral as they could.
Yet there were some crimes that must prevent
them from holding out against taking sides. One
of these concerned the condoning of treachery.</p>

<p>“Amos,” he finally said, in the other’s ear, “I
reckon we’re as one about that. We can’t stand
by and see the cause of the Allies suffer through
the work of any renegade Belgian, no matter if
he is an old man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[222]</span></p>

<p>“Good for you, Jack! I like to hear you say
that. Now tell me the next step we must take,
for talking without deeds isn’t worth a snap.”</p>

<p>“We must go down there, Amos!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and face the old folks, you mean, of
course?” ventured the other lad, fervently.</p>

<p>“We’ll tell them what we chanced to see, and
then force them to explain this mystery,” Jack
continued. “Perhaps they can do it; perhaps
there is something about this queer happening
we don’t understand. They’ve got to tell us!”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s so, Jack, we’ll put the law straight
down to them; but say, what if they choose to
defy us? Suppose they say it’s none of our
business if we’re what we claim to be,&mdash;from
across the sea,&mdash;because America isn’t in this
scrap. What then, Jack, old fellow?”</p>

<p>There was no longer any hesitation on the
part of the ranch boy. Once he had made up
his mind to do a thing, he could see his whole
course clear before him.</p>

<p>“Leave that to me, Amos,” he said, firmly.
“I’ll find a way to keep the spy fast down in that<span class="pagenum">[223]</span>
cellar until we can summon help. He must not
be allowed to escape unless his claws are first of
all well trimmed.”</p>

<p>“Now by that I guess you mean we’ll see that
he isn’t carrying any information in the shape of
a map or news about the Allies’ reserves?” Amos
ventured to say.</p>

<p>“Just about that,” added Jack. “Come, let’s
get our shoes on, and then open the trap to go
down.”</p>

<p>“They’ll be some surprised to see us so soon
again,” suggested Amos, as he started to get a
foot in a shoe.</p>

<p>“Perhaps fairly stunned as well, if, as we believe,
they’re guilty of such a foul trick against
their kind,” added Jack.</p>

<p>“Do you think the old couple would show
fight, and try to get us in a hole when they found
that we were on to their game?” asked Amos.</p>

<p>“They didn’t strike me as fighters, either one
of them,” he was told. “All the same it will pay
us to keep our eyes fixed on them pretty much all
the time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[224]</span></p>

<p>They managed to get their shoes and coats on.
To facilitate progress, Jack lighted the fragment
of tallow candle which had been left in their
charge at the time they were conducted to the
loft.</p>

<p>“I’m all ready,” announced Amos, finally.
Somehow, he did not take quite as much pains
to moderate his voice as before; perhaps he
fancied that since they meant to drop down
upon the old couple it might be as well to give
them a little warning to the effect that their
young guests were moving about.</p>

<p>So Jack bent over and lifting the trap opened
the path to the lower part of the Belgian domicile.
It was characteristic of Jack that he should
with his other arm bar the way, so that Amos
could not have preceded him even though he attempted
to do the same.</p>

<p>As the two lads came down the steep stairs
from the loft they found the man and woman
staring at them. Their whole demeanor expressed
alarm, yes, bordering on a panic. It
was as though they had suddenly realized that<span class="pagenum">[225]</span>
those above must be aware of what was going
on under that supposed to be friendly roof covering
a Belgian family.</p>

<p>When the boys advanced toward them the man
arose to his feet. He held on to the table as if for
support, showing that in his fright his limbs
threatened to give way under him.</p>

<p>Amos again felt that twinge of pity for the
two. He shut his teeth firmly together in order
to fight against any weakness. In that moment
Amos felt doubly glad it was Jack rather than
himself who would engineer matters, for he had
much more confidence in his chum than he could
ever feel in himself.</p>

<p>Jack faced the two old people, for the woman
had also managed to gain her feet, looking as
white as chalk, and with a drawn expression
about her eyes, as though she anticipated receiving
a terrible blow.</p>

<p>“W-w-what does this mean, young messieurs;
does not the bed suit you?” stammered the peasant,
trying to appear natural though the attempt
was a farce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[226]</span></p>

<p>“It was better than we had any right to expect,”
said Jack. “But by chance we found you
had entertained a visitor down here, and we have
come to ask a few questions of you. It is suspicious
that he should come in the night, and also
while it storms. You did not want any eye to
see him, so you covered the windows and fastened
the door. We may be Americans, but the
cause of the Allies is more to our liking than
that of the Kaiser; and we can’t stand idly by if
there is any treacherous work going on.”</p>

<p>The man raised his arms and let them fall
again, while his wife hid her face in her hands
and seemed to be weeping, for her shoulders
heaved convulsively.</p>

<p>“M’sieu, I do not understand!” muttered the
peasant, helplessly.</p>

<p>“Then I will try to explain better,” continued
the boy, firmly. “A stranger comes to your door
and you let him in secretly. You hold a conversation
with him. We overhear a few words
spoken, and they are in German. That looks
bad, Monsieur. It makes us believe you are in<span class="pagenum">[227]</span>
league with the enemy of your country, the same
Germany that has made Belgium a wilderness because
her sons dared oppose the passage of the
Kaiser’s great army to strike a mortal blow at
France. Are you following what I say?”</p>

<p>Amos could see that the old man, greatly
moved, had to wet his lips before he was able to
speak. It was as though his emotions almost
overpowered him; and when he did manage to
find his voice his words came as from a distance.</p>

<p>“Yes, but, M’sieu, I do not understand. Do
you mean that I, François Bart, would inform
the enemy of things that must cause the death of
Belgian soldiers?”</p>

<p>“Do you deny it then?” demanded Jack, frowning
so as to impress the other with the fact that
he and his companion were serious in all they
said and did.</p>

<p>“But, M’sieu, that would make me a traitor,
you see, and surely I would sooner have my right
hand burned off than lift it against my king,
whom we madly worship. You cannot mean
that, young M’sieu?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[228]</span></p>

<p>“Listen,” Jack continued, “all these things
which we have seen are suspicious. It is none
of our business which army wins in a square
stand-up fight; but it does concern us when
treachery is employed to stab in the back. You
deny that you mean anything that is wicked and
wrong. Then convince us of your innocence, and
we will be only too glad to go back again to our
bed and sleep.”</p>

<p>The man exchanged pitiful looks with his
wife. They conferred together in whispers and
Amos knew they were speaking in French, as
most Belgians in the lower tier of towns did,
while those toward Holland and Germany were
as a rule accustomed to talking in German when
not in Flemish.</p>

<p>“Tell me what you want me to do, young
M’sieu?” implored the old man, turning once
again toward the chums.</p>

<p>“You have secreted a stranger down below.
Even now I can hear him knocking with his
knuckles on the floor, as though he has heard
what we are saying, and wants you to move the<span class="pagenum">[229]</span>
heavy table so as to allow him to come up; but
you will, of course, not think of trying anything
like that.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;who do you suspect him of being?” faltered
the man, still wringing his hands as though
greatly stirred up.</p>

<p>“He spoke German words,” said Jack, sternly,
“and it made us believe he might be a German
spy!”</p>

<p>At that the woman gave vent to a gasp. She
threw herself forward on her knees and held up
her clasped hands to Jack.</p>

<p>“Not that, it is not that, I say to you!” she
moaned. “It is bad enough, Heaven knows, but
nothing could tempt us to have communication
with the hated enemies of our country. Our
hearts are sore, almost breaking with the shame;
but if my man was younger and had his sight he
would be there in the line, with a gun in his
hands. It is not as bad as that, oh! M’sieu, believe
me!”</p>

<p>Amos had been deeply stirred by all this. He
readily saw that the pair were in deadly earnest,<span class="pagenum">[230]</span>
and he awaited the summing up of the whole
matter with the most intense eagerness.</p>

<p>“Then you must tell us just who that stranger
is we saw come in here, and who is now hidden
under the floor. If not a German spy what is
he, François Bart?”</p>

<p>The peasant turned to the woman, as though
he dared not take the responsibility of disclosing
their great secret on his own shoulders.</p>

<p>“Shall I tell them?” he asked, hoarsely.</p>

<p>She nodded her head, and at that he burst out
with a torrent of words:</p>

<p>“He is our only son, young M’sieu, who
has been given a faint heart. Deserting from
the brave army of the king, he has come secretly
to us to hide. That is our shame, our grief.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XX" class="no-break">CHAPTER XX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">AROUSING A COWARD.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Oh! what do you think of that?” Amos was
heard to exclaim.</p>

<p>He looked as though he could hardly realize
he understood the correct meaning of the poor
old distracted peasant’s lament. François was
standing there with his head bent; his wife still
on her knees rocked to and fro with many groanings,
as though her heart might be nearly broken.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was a strange spectacle for those
two American lads, and one that gave them a
thrill. They had felt wonderfully shaken when
witnessing the rush of Teuton files on the British
lines, and watched scores, yes even hundreds of
furiously fighting men fall in heaps; but this
was entirely different. Now pity filled their boyish
hearts. They believed they could fully comprehend
the measure of shame that must wring
the hearts of this honest couple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[232]</span></p>

<p>They had but one child, and he a young man
who should be at the front standing bravely up
in defense of his beloved country. Instead of
that he had deserted from his regiment, and
made his way secretly home, possibly sending his
parents word in some way that he was coming
in order to have them hide him.</p>

<p>Those old people had the right spirit in their
hearts. The man, yes, and even the old housewife
also, would have been ready and willing to
risk and lose their own lives in the great cause
of king and country. To discover that their
only boy had a “yellow streak” in his nature filled
them with shame and bitter regret. They feared
that if the truth ever became known they might
never again look their friends and neighbors in
the face&mdash;those devoted patriots on all sides who
had made the greatest possible sacrifices.</p>

<p>Jack was almost as much shaken with compassion
for the couple as Amos gave evidence of
being. He put out a hand and seized that of the
man, which he insisted on squeezing in his whole-hearted
boyish fashion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[233]</span></p>

<p>“I am sorry that we forced you to tell us this,
François Bart,” he said, and at the time Amos
wondered why his chum spoke so loudly, until
presently he remembered that the boy soldier was
just beneath that floor, and could possibly overhear
every word that was said, as Jack doubtless
intended should be the case.</p>

<p>“You see, M’sieu,” explained the peasant abjectly,
“Jean is our child, and we love him. We
could not turn him away from our door, for if
seen he might be arrested and shot at ten paces.
So we are in great distress of mind. We could
let everything we have in this world go, and still
smile, but to know that our flesh and blood is a&mdash;<em>coward</em>.
Oh! that is worse than death itself
to both of us.”</p>

<p>“Then you do not stand back of him in his desertion?”
asked Jack.</p>

<p>“M’sieu, if the news came to us that our Jean
had fallen covered with glory in his place at the
front we could rejoice, and be satisfied, for we
must always remember that he gave his poor life
for our country. But that he should turn out to<span class="pagenum">[234]</span>
be a deserter, and run from duty breaks our
hearts!”</p>

<p>Jack felt sure he detected some sort of movement
under the floor. He believed the wretched
Jean must have his ear pressed against the
boards, and was not losing a single word of all
that they said. So when he spoke again the
ranch boy kept his voice at a pitch sufficiently
high to be heard.</p>

<p>“We are sorry for you, François,” he said.
“It must be a terrible thing for a father and
mother in Belgium to know that their only son is
a coward, and that he has allowed his fears to
force him to shirk his plain duty to his king.
Have you done all you can to convince him of
his mistake?”</p>

<p>“M’sieu, we have pleaded, and almost threatened,
but he keeps on saying that although his
heart seems to be brave enough, his legs refuse
to carry him again into the terrible battle where
his comrades are falling all around him.”</p>

<p>“Then he has already been under fire?” asked
Jack, in a surprised tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[235]</span></p>

<p>“Oh! yes, and one of his friends who came
back badly wounded told us Jean was showing
himself almost a hero. We believed that the old
failing in his blood had been conquered. Then
we had word from him, and this night he came,
trembling with fear, saying that he must be hidden
until he could find a chance to cross over
into England where he would be safe.”</p>

<p>“Try once more to arouse him,” said Jack.
“Appeal to him by everything that he holds dear.
Tell him that you would sooner see him brought
home dead than that he desert in the face of
danger. Perhaps the spasm of fear may have
passed by then. He may have come to his senses,
and realize that his true nature is not that of a
coward. He has already shown that he can
stand up under fire and give a good account of
himself. And, François, we both hope all may
come out well with you&mdash;and Jean! Now we
will be glad to go up into the loft once more and
get some sleep.”</p>

<p>The peasant looked a little more hopeful; even
his wife arose from her knees, to the great relief<span class="pagenum">[236]</span>
of Amos, who disliked very much seeing her in
that position.</p>

<p>“It is kind of you, young M’sieu!” exclaimed
the man. “Then you believe what we have told
you? You no longer suspect us of harboring a
German spy under our poor roof?”</p>

<p>“We are sorry for you, that is all,” Jack told
him. “You need fear nothing from us, since
we would not betray your secret for worlds. All
we hope is that your boy Jean will be able to
shake himself together, and resolve to go back
to his duty like every Belgian who is worth his
salt is doing this day. Come along, Amos, let’s
try for another sleep.”</p>

<p>When the two boys had climbed once more
into the loft, to find the candle still lighted as
Jack had left it, of course the first thing Amos
did was to ask his chum a few questions that
were burning on his tongue.</p>

<p>“Do you think he heard what was said, Jack;
and was that the reason you spoke in such a loud
tone?”</p>

<p>“You’ve guessed it, Amos. Somehow, I felt<span class="pagenum">[237]</span>
so sorry for that poor couple in their bitter humiliation
and shame that I just wanted to see if
I couldn’t arouse whatever spark of patriotism
there might be in Jean’s soul. Yes, I’m sure he
caught every word we said.”</p>

<p>“The question is, will it do him a particle of
good, Jack? He must be a pretty poor specimen
of a young fellow to act the way he has.”</p>

<p>“Well, that can only be proved by time,” Jack
told him, with a shake of his head. “It would
be next door to a miracle, of course, and yet
such things have happened before and may again.
Honestly, I don’t believe the boy’s such a terrible
coward as he lets himself think.”</p>

<p>“He passed through more or less fighting, they
said.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and something has happened to give
him a scare,” declared Jack, who had a sagacious
way of looking at all such things. “If he
could get a firm grip on himself once more there’s
still a chance that he might win honors enough to
wipe out the disgrace he’s made his folks feel.
Anyway, I hope that will happen.”</p>

<p>From the way Jack yawned it was evident that<span class="pagenum">[238]</span>
he did not feel like discussing the matter any
further. Amos took the hint, for he, too, began
to feel sleepy, now that the cause of their recent
excitement had passed away.</p>

<p>So he also gaped, and started to crawl under
the covers, after he had again removed his shoes
and coat. Jack blew out the candle, and in the
darkness they composed themselves to forget all
their troubles. Since Amos was so deeply concerned
in finding his long missing brother, whom
he really believed to be in the ranks of the Allies
serving as an aviator, this often proved to be a
difficult task; but being unusually tired after
that arduous day, he presently managed to lose
himself once more.</p>

<p>The long night passed. If from time to time
there stole in through the open window of that
loft in the humble Belgian cottage the deep-throated
growl of those great German howitzers
such as had reduced the steel forts at Liége,
Namur and since then other fortifications
deemed impregnable, the sound did not seem to
disturb the chums any more than distant thunder<span class="pagenum">[239]</span>
would have done. They were by this time becoming
so accustomed to hearing the mutterings
of fierce war that they did not pay as much attention
to the same as had been the case some
time back.</p>

<p>There was no further cause for a sudden
awakening. Once, however, when Jack found
himself awake he raised his head to listen, thinking
the low murmur of voices had sifted to his
ears. When he made sure that it came from below
he might have smiled as though satisfied,
but the fact could not be made manifest in the
gloom of that loft.</p>

<p>“I wonder if the seed did take root, and will it
grow?” was all Jack whispered to himself, as he
calmly turned over to continue his interrupted
sleep.</p>

<p>So the dawn found them. Daylight, sweeping
in through the small windows told Jack it was
time they were up. He aroused Amos, who was
apparently content to linger indefinitely in his
cozy bed.</p>

<p>“It’s morning, Amos!” he called out. “Time<span class="pagenum">[240]</span>
we were moving, if we mean to do anything
today.”</p>

<p>“And say, Jack, seems to me I can smell cooking
going on in the bargain, which is always as
good as a goad to get me out of bed,” with which
Amos proceeded to reach for his shoes.</p>

<p>Yes, they could hear the old couple moving
about below stairs. Jack was not sure but it did
seem to him that their footsteps had a more
sprightly ring. Somehow the very suspicion of
such a thing did him good, though he did not
think it worth while to mention the fact to Amos.</p>

<p>“We must be on the border of Ypres, don’t
you think?” Amos remarked, showing that he
was naturally thinking of the chances they had
of finding the daring aviator who answered to
the name of Frank Bradford, and whom he fully
believed must be his own brother.</p>

<p>“Everything points that way,” replied Jack.
“Looking out, I’ve already seen troops hurrying
past, British Tommies at that, and all looking
fit for any kind of fighting if their eager faces
counted for anything. But if you’re ready we’ll<span class="pagenum">[241]</span>
go down below, get a bite, and then make the
old people accept all we can spare; for the
chances are they’ll need every franc they can get
together before the end of this nasty business
comes around.”</p>

<p>Amos was thinking mostly of the delightful
odor of cooking as he came down the ladder-like
stairs that led from the loft to the lower floor of
the cottage. With Jack it was somewhat different,
for his first thought was to look keenly at
François and his wife, who had faced about on
hearing the trap raised.</p>

<p>When Jack saw that the careworn expression
had been magically lifted from those furrowed
faces he felt almost like giving a shout of real
satisfaction.</p>

<p>Straight over to them he hurried, still keeping
his eyes fastened on their telltale faces.</p>

<p>“What is the good word, François?” he asked,
in his straight-from-the-shoulder fashion; and
indeed there was hardly any necessity to even ask
that much, Jack thought, since appearances
speak more loudly than words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[242]</span></p>

<p>“Oh! young M’sieu, what can we say to thank
you?” burst out the old peasant, while his good
wife nodded vehemently to show that in her
mind she echoed all her “good man” said. “The
best that ever could happen has come to us. Jean
has seen a great light. He has won the great
victory over himself. Yes, he signalled to me to
let him come up, and then and there he swore
that he would go straight back to his place in
the fighting line, and die a dozen deaths before
quitting again. We are so happy! Now we can
look our friends and neighbors in the face without
feeling a cold hand at our hearts. Jean may
live to see us again; but if he should not surely
the Good Father above will console us if we knew
that he died for the king!”</p>

<p>Amos had to furtively rub his eyes as though
some mote had suddenly blown in there; even
Jack felt his own vision a little obscured as he
pressed the hands of the relieved old people, who
no longer held their heads down in shame.</p>

<p>“Come,” said Jack, cheerily, “let’s have a bite
and then we must leave you, François.”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">BOMBARDED BY A ZEPPELIN.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Shortly afterwards the two boys said good-bye
to their host and his wife, and started out to
find headquarters in Ypres. They quickly discovered
that the badly battered town was full of
marching soldiers, and all the other things that
go hand in hand with modern war, even to a
number of armored cars which sped past them on
the road, exciting the wonder of Amos greatly.</p>

<p>“Why, just see how they’ve managed to build
up that metal shield around the men aboard,
Jack! They seem to be safe from ordinary bullets
fired by a machine gun. There were two
Maxims aboard that last car, I noticed.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added the other, deeply interested,
“fighting today begins to take on some of the
old-time ways. You’d almost think of Roman
chariots to see those cars flying along the road,<span class="pagenum">[244]</span>
only the galloping horses have been displaced
by a power a hundred times more powerful.
But there must have been some pretty warm engagements
around this town, if the battered
walls can tell the story.”</p>

<p>“Huh! it doesn’t look to me worth the powder
that’s been wasted,” remarked Amos. “Why
should both Germans and the Allies want to get
and hold possession of Ypres, I’d like to know?
Thousands must have fallen here, because everywhere
you look you see those mounds where the
dead have been buried.”</p>

<p>“They consider it a place of strategic importance,
which is the only explanation I can give
you,” Jack observed. “Perhaps it’s what we’d
call a railway center over in the States. Then
the only good road leading to Dunkirk and the
Channel runs out from Ypres; and you know the
Kaiser is dead set on getting his army where he
can throw those shells over on to the shore of
England. That mania with him has cost pretty
much all this terrible slaughter.”</p>

<p>Amos shook his head as though his feelings<span class="pagenum">[245]</span>
overpowered him. He must have been thinking
that human life was held pretty cheaply when it
could be thus thrown away for a freak idea, a
pet object of revenge that in the end could not
amount to much so far as ending the war was
concerned.</p>

<p>Of course, the two boys aroused considerable
curiosity. It was only natural that this should
be so. Dozens of the soldiers, humming <cite>Tipperary</cite>
as they strode past in ranks, usually heading
toward the fighting zone, waved a hand toward
them in friendly greeting; and the chums
invariably gave an answering salute.</p>

<p>“I guess they think we’re English boys,” suggested
Amos, when this had happened a number
of times. “They know from our looks, and the
fact of our being here, we can never be German
anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Now, I’m of the opinion they glimpse that
little flag in your buttonhole,” ventured Jack,
quickly. “It tells them who and what we are.
While the United States is trying hard to be
neutral in this big war, and treat both sides alike,<span class="pagenum">[246]</span>
still, as Germany can’t get any war supplies and
the Allies do, on account of their controlling the
Seven Seas, these British must look on us as
near-allies. Besides, if they ever read the papers
printed on our side of the water they’d know
that the biggest part of the American nation believes
in their cause, and prays that in the end
militarism will be knocked out, with a new Germany
to rise on the ruins of the old.”</p>

<p>That might sound like pretty strong talk coming
from a boy; but then Jack was wise beyond
his years. Besides, he had looked upon strange
sights since coming abroad. Education develops
rapidly under such conditions.</p>

<p>“I should say Headquarters might lie over in
that direction, Jack?” suggested Amos, pointing
as he spoke. “I notice that in most cases the
troops come from that way, which would tell the
story, you know.”</p>

<p>“Good idea, Amos, and one that does your Boy
Scout training credit. According to my mind
it’s just as you say, and we’ll see if we can get
an interview with the general commanding this<span class="pagenum">[247]</span>
district. He must be a mighty busy man, and
only for that magical letter of introduction we’re
carrying around with us I’m afraid our chances
of seeing him and getting a little confab would
be next to nothing. But when he looks on that
signature K. of K. there’s little he can refuse us.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Amos, grinning happily, “that
was a master stroke on your part, asking dad to
give us a letter to his old friend and comrade,
General Kitchener, after you learned how close
they had once been in South Africa or Egypt
long ago. When I see their eyebrows go up, and
that look come on their faces, it makes me think
of a talisman such as they used of old. I can
imagine Ali Baba saying the magical words
‘open sesame’ before the rock wall that always
swung open to the signal. We’ve got the same
wonderful magnet in our well-worn letter signed
by the Minister of War over in London.”</p>

<p>Moving steadily along they quickly found
themselves getting among crowds of civilians
and soldiers who filled the streets of the little old
Belgian town, now a ruined place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[248]</span></p>

<p>“What are they all staring up at, I wonder?”
remarked Amos. “It must be some of those rash
pilots driving German Taubes are circling
around again, trying to locate hidden batteries
of the Allies. Oh! Jack, look there, that’s a
Zeppelin I do believe.”</p>

<p>Jack had already decided this for himself.
Away up among the fleecy clouds of the early
morning they could see what looked like a bulky
cigar-shaped object that was speeding along its
course. It was too high for any anti-air craft
gun to hope to reach it. Possibly Allied birdmen
would presently be sent aloft to try and engage
the enemy, or failing that chase him off.</p>

<p>All at once there arose a shout that was taken
up by a thousand excited voices. The entire
crowd started to sway and break. Men dashed
for any sort of shelter that came most convenient.
Others threw themselves flat upon their
faces, believing in their sudden panic they would
be in far less danger if they hugged the ground
closely.</p>

<p>Jack had himself detected some object falling<span class="pagenum">[249]</span>
from aloft. It might have been a cast-off sandbag,
but in these perilous war times one must expect
something more destructive than this. He
too would have followed the example of those
close by and dropped flat, only that he saw the
falling object was bound to miss the spot where
he and his chum stood by a big margin. In fact,
it would drop outside the town, as the hostile airship
was at too high an altitude for the marksman
to aim with any reasonable certainty of
success.</p>

<p><a id="Ref_249"></a>Instantly there came a terrific boom. Jack
and Amos felt the ground tremble under them
with the concussion, and they did not need to be
told it had been a most destructive bomb that
had been dropped from the swiftly moving Zeppelin.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 459px;">
<img src="images/i253.jpg" width="459" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Instantly there came a terrific boom.&mdash;<a href="#Ref_249"><em>Page 249.</em></a></p></div>
</div>

<p>Almost immediately afterwards came a second
shock, with the same quiver of the racked earth
following the explosion. When even a third
made the atmosphere seem to be surcharged with
thunder Amos sank to his knees and pulled at
the legs of his companion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[250]</span></p>

<p>“Drop down, Jack,” he called, almost frantically.
“How do we know but what the very
next bomb will be close by? We don’t want to
be torn into fragments if we can help it, do we?”</p>

<p>“It’s all over, I reckon, by now,” Jack assured
him. “The Zeppelin seems to have passed well
over us; and besides there’s a whole flock of
Allied aeroplanes rising like birds to give chase.
This wreck of a town has had another close call,
I take it. Those bombs were terrible ones, and
must have been meant for a purpose.”</p>

<p>“What do you think the Germans were after?
I don’t suppose now they knew for a minute
Jack Maxfield and Amos Turner had come to
town?”</p>

<p>Of course Jack understood that his chum was
only saying this in a spirit of sport.</p>

<p>“They’re after bigger game than two American
boys this time, Amos,” he said.</p>

<p>“Then you think they meant to catch somebody
high up in authority; is that it?” demanded
the other.</p>

<p>“It has probably become known through some<span class="pagenum">[251]</span>
of those secret channels by which the Germans
learn so much that the British have their headquarters
established somewhere in Ypres just
now, even if it is shifted often to confuse them.
And because the fighting line has been pushed
so far away they can’t send shells in here they’ve
resorted to another means for trying to give the
British a scare.”</p>

<p>“The crowd’s pushing over to view what happened,”
remarked Amos; “shall we go, too, and
find out what a bomb dropped by a Zeppelin
can do?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to say I’d seen the effect of such a
thing,” returned Jack. “We’re not in such a
rushing hurry but what we can afford the little
time it’ll be likely to take; so come along, Amos.”</p>

<p>Together then they joined the throng that was
hurrying toward the quarter where that last terrible
air bomb had exploded on striking the earth.</p>

<p>“What great luck that it fell in an open place,
and never a human being was injured, seems
like!” exclaimed Amos, gaping at the tremendous<span class="pagenum">[252]</span>
hole in the ground, with the earth thrown in
every direction for a distance of many yards.</p>

<p>“If a monster meteor, hissing hot, had fallen
here it couldn’t have smashed things worse than
that!” Jack declared. “From the way things
are thrown around I’d say if that bomb ever
struck a house the people inside would never
know what had happened.”</p>

<p>“Then they shot it down at haphazard, or else
knew in what part of the town Headquarters lay,
and aimed to hit the same?” suggested Amos.</p>

<p>A soldier in khaki overheard them and started
a conversation. Doubtless he was more or less
curious to know who and what they were, and
why they had the run of the British camps when
so many spies were known to be prowling around.
He seemed to eye them more or less suspiciously,
especially when Jack made no effort to enter into
explanations, not caring to take every ordinary
Tommy into his confidence.</p>

<p>In the end this happened to bring them into
new difficulties, for the soldier must have immediately
gone about voicing his suspicions, because<span class="pagenum">[253]</span>
about the time Jack said they had seen enough
and had better be going Amos noticed that quite
a number of soldiers started to cluster around
them, nor did they show any intention of opening
up to let the two boys pass.</p>

<p>Angry looks were being bent on the lads.
Amos was indignant, but Jack could easily understand
what a little thing in these days of bitter
warfare can cause the seeds of suspicion to
be sown, making the harvest quick and unpleasant.</p>

<p>Just then an officer came bustling up, followed
by another bunch of Tommies, and Jack understood
what had happened when he saw in their
midst the very same tall man in khaki who had
tried to pry into their affairs.</p>

<p>“There they are, Captain!”</p>

<p>“German spies they must be!” called out another
voice.</p>

<p>“Ten to one they signalled to that same airship
where to drop the bally old bombs!” cried
a third soldier, angrily.</p>

<p>Loud outcries attested to the ugly temper of<span class="pagenum">[254]</span>
the gathering crowd. There could be no telling
to what ends that mob might go, sooner or later.
Despite the fact that they were amenable to military
orders they might get beyond the control of
authority, and start to wreak summary vengeance
upon the boys, neither of whom showed
any signs of being alarmed.</p>

<p>“Captain,” said Jack, quietly, though he had
to raise his voice so as to be heard above the
rising clamor, “we are just what we say, American
boys. We have made our way into Ypres
in order to see your commanding officer. It is
foolish for any one to connect us with that German
Zeppelin, when we were in just as much danger
as the rest. Please take us to Headquarters
without any delay. We have something to show
the general; and after he has seen it you will find
that he’ll extend the honors of the camp to us.”</p>

<p>The captain must have known that if he held
back much longer the excited men were apt to
get out of bonds, and do something that would
not be according to military discipline; so he<span class="pagenum">[255]</span>
evidently determined to follow the advice of the
boy who seemed to be able to retain his presence
of mind, regardless of the overhanging difficulties.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum">[256]</span>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXII" class="no-break">CHAPTER XXII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">AT HEADQUARTERS IN YPRES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Both of you boys come with me,” the British
captain told them, evidently capable of acting on
the spur of the moment. “I’ll see that you get
to Headquarters all right.”</p>

<p>His actions told that he was a man who knew
what to do in an emergency. First of all he
stepped between the boys, and put an arm
through theirs. Then he commanded a batch of
passing soldiers under a subaltern to swing
around them, so that on every side they were
protected from the crowd.</p>

<p>After that they started off briskly. Jack
looked at his chum and nodded his head as if to
say that it was more than fortunate for them
they chanced to come across such a level-headed
officer in their time of need.</p>

<p>A crowd started to follow after them, and seeing<span class="pagenum">[257]</span>
this the resolute captain gave a sharp order
that caused the guard to turn and make threatening
gestures with the bayonets on their guns.
After that, as though recognizing the fact that
such an officer was not to be trifled with, the mob
fell back and scattered into fractions.</p>

<p>The danger was evidently past, at least so far
as that quarter was concerned. It remained to
be seen how they would get on with the general.
Having the utmost faith in the talisman they
carried, neither Jack nor Amos felt much fear.
In this crisis of the country’s history none but
sensible men would be in command of the King’s
forces in the field; and they could depend on just
treatment, which was all they asked.</p>

<p>There was evidently no desire in those days
of hovering Zeppelins and hostile aeroplanes
capable of dropping dangerous bombs, to make
Headquarters in any way conspicuous. No flags
decorated the humble building to which the
American boys were now taken. In fact, unless
the steady flow of messengers and orderlies
were noted one would never dream a general<span class="pagenum">[258]</span>
high in authority had taken it over for his personal
quarters.</p>

<p>“Remain here while I see if the general is in
and can give you a few minutes,” was what the
captain told them, with which he vanished beyond
the two grim sentries who guarded the
doorway.</p>

<p>“Let me tell you we’ve been mighty lucky to
have such a friend bob up when we needed one,”
remarked Jack, as they awaited the reappearance
of the officer.</p>

<p>“I kind of think he’s taken quite a fancy to
you, Jack,” the other observed. “He must have
a soft spot in his heart for Americans. Every
time he looked around at one of us he’d sort of
smile. I’m going to ask him if he ever lived
across the water in our country. Here he comes.
I think it’s all right, and the general will see us,
because he looks as ‘pleased as Punch,’ as these
Britishers say.”</p>

<p>Amos guessed rightly, for the captain nodded
his head as he came up to them, still surrounded
by the men in khaki.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[259]</span></p>

<p>“You are to come in with me, boys. The general
has a few minutes of leisure, and will listen
to what you have to say,” he told them, as he
dismissed the men.</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll excuse me, Captain,” said Amos,
bent on satisfying his curiosity on the spur of the
moment. “Something seems to tell me you know
America. Am I right about that, or is it a bad
guess, sir?”</p>

<p>“I spent several years in Washington as an
attaché to our Embassy there,” the officer confessed.
“It happens that I married an American
woman, so I can assure you I have a great
many good friends over there, two of whom I
happen to know are in the Foreign Legion that
was organized in Paris to fight Prussian militarism.
But come with me, as the general’s time
is precious. Whatever your errand may be over
here I wish you good luck.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Captain, and the same to you!” exclaimed
Amos, as he gave Jack a wink, desiring
to call his attention to the fact that for once his
guess had hit the bull’s-eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[260]</span></p>

<p>A minute later and they were ushered into the
presence of the general. Amos felt immediately
that they would not have any difficulty in gaining
the good will of this high functionary. He
had a keen eye, and surveyed the two American
boys curiously, as though finding it difficult to
understand why they should have been allowed to
roam almost at will over these fighting zones,
when other non-combatants were swept far to
the rear for many reasons.</p>

<p>“Captain Sperry informs me you wished to
have a brief talk with me,” was what the general
said in quick, terse tones that denoted unusual
energy. “First of all tell me who you are, why
you are here, and how in the name of all that’s
wonderful you have been allowed safe conduct
through this war-torn region.”</p>

<p>As was usually the case, Jack took it upon himself
to do the talking. Amos always admitted
that he was not in the same class with his cousin
when it came to making a good use of his vocal
organs. In other words, to use the words of
some of their boy friends across the water, Jack<span class="pagenum">[261]</span>
had the “gift of gab,” and had often been put
in the “spell-binder” division.</p>

<p>So Jack introduced Amos and himself. He
went right at the root of the matter, telling how
Frank Turner had left home under a cloud, and
then how some years later his complete innocence
had been established so strangely.</p>

<p>Having in this fashion interested the general,
who was human even though a stern soldier, perhaps
a martinet in his way as well, Jack explained
how they had been given a letter of introduction
to Lord Kitchener, and that the father of his
chum had once been a warm friend of the great
soldier in the Soudan.</p>

<p>In somewhat of a dramatic fashion Jack told
how they had been given a paper by the British
War Minister, and then presented the well-worn
document to the astonished general. He examined
it eagerly, and then looked at the two boys.
The stern expression on his strong face had
changed to a friendly smile, owing to first of all
the spell of Jack’s boyish oratory, and then the
sight of that honored signature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[262]</span></p>

<p>“You are fortunate indeed, my young
friends,” he told them, “in having such a backing.
I do not wonder any longer that you have
been able to penetrate our lines, and see much
that has been going on, which other eyes have
not been able to observe. But I sincerely hope
you may never fall into the hands of the Germans,
for that wonderful paper would seal your
fate. They would convict you as spies sent out
by Lord Kitchener. Now tell me what I can do
for you?”</p>

<p>This was just what Jack was waiting for.
Accordingly he explained how in various ways
they had come to firmly believe that the missing
Frank Turner had taken up aviation, and that
at the breaking out of the war had joined the
British aerial corps under the name of Frank
Bradford.</p>

<p>Jack was watching when he said this, and,
just as he anticipated, the general and captain,
the latter of whom had been asked to remain in
the room during the interview, showed immediate
signs of renewed interest, proving that they<span class="pagenum">[263]</span>
recognized the name as belonging to one of their
most daring air pilots.</p>

<p>“If it turns out as you believe,” said the general,
after Jack had gone on to explain how they
seemed to be chasing after a will-o’-the-wisp,
since Frank Bradford was heard of first in one
part of the country and then in another more
remote region&mdash;“you have every reason to be
proud of that missing brother. He has been
a bulwark of insurance for our cause. There is
hardly another aviator who has proven such a
thorn in the flesh to the enemy as Frank Bradford.
I had not learned that he was really an
American. How about you, Captain?”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes, I was told so, General, though as a
rule it was not generally known. I have never
met him, though other pilots have spoken of
him to me, and all seem to admire his wonderful
nerve and skill.”</p>

<p>“Do you happen to know where he could be
found at present, Captain?” asked the commanding
officer, bent on assisting the two brave boys
as far as he could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[264]</span></p>

<p>“I heard some one say,” the other replied,
“just a few days back, that he ran across Frank
Bradford at the front with your aerial squad,
General.”</p>

<p>“Of course, I would hardly have known of it,”
remarked the commanding officer, “because these
men are modest, and hide their light under a
bushel, being often designated only by a number.
It is too bad that you boys did not know
this when you were close to the front.”</p>

<p>“We watched a number of aviators flying and
sending signals,” Jack explained; “and my cousin
even suggested that one of them might be his
brother; but we had no means of knowing, and
thought the only way to find out would be to
make direct for Headquarters, General.”</p>

<p>Amos looked bitterly disappointed. To think
that they may have been so close to the one they
were seeking and then miss him was aggravating,
to say the least.</p>

<p>“If you are so bent on finding him,” said the
general, as though he could tell from the look on
Jack’s face there was no thought of letting a<span class="pagenum">[265]</span>
little thing like this discourage them, “I will do
what I can to help you out.”</p>

<p>“It is very kind of you to say that, General!”
declared Jack, his face beaming with a broad
smile as he turned toward Amos and winked.</p>

<p>The commanding officer drew a pad of paper
toward him and hurriedly wrote several lines
upon a sheet, after which he signed it.</p>

<p>“That will allow you to continue your search,
my lads,” he said, as he handed the document
to Jack, who folded and carefully placed it in an
inner pocket without reading what the other had
written. “I deplore the necessity that will take
you once more through the dangerous zone of
fire, because it would grieve me to hear that any
accident had befallen you. We British know how
to admire valor in boys; and I rejoice to know
that our American cousins across the sea possess
the same manly spirit we love to see in our own
kith and kin at home.”</p>

<p>The general actually held out his hand to them,
which Jack reckoned to be an unusual thing for
a commanding officer to do. But of course he<span class="pagenum">[266]</span>
could unbend his dignity when dealing with boys,
and this meeting must have been a refreshing
break in the monotony of strictly military doings.</p>

<p>“The best of luck attend your search,” he told
them at parting. “While I may sympathize with
the sacred object of your mission, deep down in
my heart I am hoping your brother will consider
it his duty to stick by his task. The Allies can
ill afford to lose so brilliant a pilot at just this
critical stage of the terrible game of war.”</p>

<p>Jack knew that the busy general had given
them much more of his valuable time than common
prudence would have dictated. That was
because he had taken an interest in their fortunes,
and also in themselves as typical representatives
of Young America. So Jack bowed
and backed away, in which he was imitated by
Amos.</p>

<p>Once again they were in the open air, with the
deep muttering of the battle coming from the
front. The captain now held out his hand as
though to say he had pressing duties to attend<span class="pagenum">[267]</span>
to, and could not spare further time to accompany
them.</p>

<p>“We may be ordered to take our places in the
line at almost any minute,” he explained, “and
I should be with my men, who are chafing at the
delay, being wild to get in action. So I will echo
all the general said. The best of luck attend
you both, my lads. I have two boys at home,
and I assure you they love the country of their
mother as well as that to which their father owes
allegiance.”</p>

<p>When they found themselves free to act the
first thing Jack did was to take out the paper
given into his charge by the commanding officer
and examine it, with Amos leaning over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Brief and to the point, as a soldier’s communications
always should be,” observed Jack;
“but it covers the ground, and will keep any
British or Belgian patrol from interfering with
our movements. I hardly think such liberty has
been granted to any other non-combatant in this<span class="pagenum">[268]</span>
war. On the whole, I can see where it’s going
to help me out in my letters to my paper.”</p>

<p>“And now we’ve got to cover the same ground
again, do we?” asked Amos.</p>

<p>“Pretty much so,” he was told by his comrade.
“Only with this paper from the general we may
look to have all sorts of favors granted to us.
Who knows but what we may get a ride part of
the way in an automobile, or on a motor truck
going for the injured? I mean to make an effort,
if a chance comes along.”</p>

</div>


<p>“There’s the cottage of François Bart,” observed
Amos, some time later, as they passed
through the village on the outskirts of Ypres.</p>

<p>“Yes, and some one is waving to us from the
open door,” added Jack. “It must be his good
wife, and she has recognized her lodgers of last
night.”</p>

<p>“I hope they get no bad news about their boy
from the front where the Belgian army is holding
out so stubbornly,” said Amos, reflectively.</p>

<p>“So long as he stands up to the job neither of
them will complain,” the other commented.
“They felt the disgrace much more than they
would the stab if news came that Jean had fallen
while doing his duty for his country.”</p>

<p>“For one I’m glad we had a chance to run
across a little side drama like that, Jack. It<span class="pagenum">[270]</span>
showed us of what stuff these patriotic Belgians
are made. And you can find some mighty bright
material for your correspondence in that happening,
too.”</p>

<p>Chatting after this fashion they trudged along.
The way seemed fairly familiar to them, since
they had so recently come over it. As before,
the road was at times almost clogged with the
numerous vehicles passing back and forth.
These consisted altogether of motor vans or lorries
going after more wounded, or fetching loads
of the same from the front where the battle still
raged; cars containing officers hurrying to the
fighting line; artillery trains of cannon; supplies;
ammunition, and even more armored cars.</p>

<p>Then at one time the boys had to get out of
the way when a squadron of hard-riding cavalry
swept past. Jack again believed many of these
men must have come from the Canadian Northwest,
for they sat their saddles after the free and
easy fashion of cowboys. He was almost tempted
to give vent to a whoop just to see if some of
them would answer; but discretion or second<span class="pagenum">[271]</span>
thought caused him to forego this, as it could do
them no good, and might get them into trouble.</p>

<p>“Here comes a van heading our way,” called
out Amos, about half an hour after they had left
Ypres, “and it seems to be nearly empty for a
change. Most of them are chock full of Tommies
being rushed forward. Jack, will you make
the try with that paper the general gave us?”</p>

<p>“Surely,” returned the other, “if we can get
them to stop. Here’s a bad spot in the road, and
they’ll have to go slow in passing. Now to see
what luck we have.”</p>

<p>When Jack made motions indicating that he
wanted the driver of the motor van to stop,
possibly that worthy, seeing the bad spot in the
road, feared he might become mired. At any
rate he pulled up. Jack had his paper ready, and
stepping up shoved it up at the chauffeur, who
was undoubtedly a Britisher, perhaps one who
had up to recently been driving some business
van or motor ’bus in the congested streets of
London.</p>

<p>“Please read this communication given to us<span class="pagenum">[272]</span>
by the general in command,” was what the boy
said, without any show of bluster.</p>

<p>When the chauffeur glanced over the brief but
pointed order that every one in authority should
render assistance to the bearer and his companion,
he knew instinctively what was wanted,
for he at once made room on the seat.</p>

<p>“If you want to go along, get aboard, young
fellows!” he said, and without waiting for further
invitation they both clambered up alongside,
after which the big van started on again, bent on
taking another load of wounded to the hospitals
in the rear, perhaps at Dunkirk.</p>

<p>Amos noticed that the bottom of the van was
covered with fresh hay, and he was glad to discover
no signs of previous occupancy.</p>

<p>The driver was curious to know why two boys
were roaming around close to where tens of thousands
of soldiers were engaged in the gruesome
task of killing each other; it was only natural
he should feel this way, for that document he
had examined, signed by the general, told him<span class="pagenum">[273]</span>
Jack and Amos were no ordinary strollers bent
on seeing the sights.</p>

<p>Jack thought it best to tell him just a little
so that he might understand how they stood in
with the commander-in-chief at Ypres Headquarters.
It was as small a compensation as they
could make in return for being given such a
splendid lift on their way.</p>

<p>Louder grew the discordant sounds that spoke
of the hot work being done along a line that must
cover many miles of front. In places the Germans
must be attacking furiously again, hurling
masses of fresh troops forward in hopes of
pressing the Allies back once more.</p>

<p>“But they’ve shot their blooming bolt,” said
the van driver, exultantly. “Gas is wot done it,
I tell you; but our men have turned and pushed
the mob back a full mile or so, I hears. There
we stick, and they can’t budge us, try it as they
will.”</p>

<p>Every chance Amos got, when the road was
fairly clear of trees ahead, he leaned forward
and seemed to be intently examining the heavens<span class="pagenum">[274]</span>
as though fearful that it might start in and rain
again.</p>

<p>Jack knew, however, it was something besides
this that was causing the other to act as he did;
and that it concerned those venturesome fliers
who during the entire day would be sailing back
and forth through the upper air currents, spying
on the troop movements of the enemy, and sending
numerous valuable messages back to those
who with glasses bearing on the aeroplanes were
reading to receive such news as came.</p>

<p>“I can see half a dozen of them sailing around
away off there, Jack,” remarked Amos, with a
vein of deep anxiety in his voice and manner. “I
wonder if one of them can be Frank. They’re
too far away right now for me to say which
belong to the Allies and which are Taubes of the
enemy.”</p>

<p>The chauffeur, while not knowing why they
should have any particular interest in aeroplanes,
kindly volunteered to pick out those that were
connected with the cause of the Allies.</p>

<p>“Germans always have a queer way of flying,”<span class="pagenum">[275]</span>
he explained. “They all learn to do things the
same way like they was parts of a big machine.
Our men go it every one like he learned his own
style. But say, boys, I have to turn off the road
here and follow this trail which leads to a hospital
where I gets me load. If so be you’d want
to keep on that way you’re welcome to stay
aboard with me.”</p>

<p>Jack, however, believed that their end would
be best attained if they kept on in a direct line
for the village where they had passed that night
at the time the great German drive broke like
a water dam, and pressed the Allied armies back
for several miles.</p>

<p>They trudged along for half a mile. Then
back of them came a battery of field guns, swinging
to the front for service. The boys stepped
out of the way, and as the artillery swept past
they waved a hand to the grim men in khaki
sitting on the seats of gun carriage and caisson.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t mind riding on one of those, given
half a chance,” Amos was saying a little enviously,
for as the horses were galloping there<span class="pagenum">[276]</span>
was a promise that the fresh battery would soon
be wheeled in position to take toll of the charging
Prussians.</p>

<p>“Look there!” exclaimed Jack. “The very last
caisson has pulled up right in front of us you
might say. Something gone a little wrong with
a part of the harness, most likely. I wonder if
our pass from the general would get us a seat on
that ammunition cart!”</p>

<p>“Try it, Jack!” advised his chum eagerly. “I’m
not so struck on this walking that I’d refuse a
chance to ride on any kind of vehicle. Besides,
it’ll take us to the front all the sooner, you know.”</p>

<p>There were three men with the caisson that
had stopped on the road. Two of them were
hurriedly fixing the harness so that it would
work easier. The third Jack saw must be a non-commissioned
officer, perhaps a corporal, who
could afford to sit there and order the others
what to do.</p>

<p>Stepping quickly up, Jack held out his paper.</p>

<p>“This is signed by your general, sir,” he said
rapidly, for fear the halt would be discontinued<span class="pagenum">[277]</span>
before he had found his chance to make good.</p>

<p>“It’s altogether unusual, I know, but we
are anxious to get forward, and would like to
be allowed to sit on the chest at the back while
you push ahead.”</p>

<p>“Utterly impossible, boy!” exclaimed the other,
but about the same time he took in what the commanding
general had written, and his eyes opened
wide as he hastened to add. “Why, I hardly
know what my duty is. By this document I am
commanded to assist you two boys in every way
possible, no matter whether it is against general
orders or not. Jump up and hold on, then, for
we will have to move rapidly in order to overtake
the rest of the battery!”</p>

<p>Jack hastily put the paper safely away. He
would not like to lose that valuable document for
a great deal, since it must stand as their sponsor
in the hunt for Frank Bradford. Hardly had
he and Amos secured a seat on the ammunition
chest than the two gunners hustled into their
places. Then the horses were started on a furious
gallop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[278]</span></p>

<p><a id="Ref_278"></a>The two boys would never forget that wild
ride over the rutty roads beyond Ypres, where
in places German shells had torn deep holes that
had later been filled up after a certain fashion.
They had more or less difficulty in holding on,
for the caisson jumped frightfully when passing
over these ruts and holes. The whip was not
spared, and the steaming horses did their best to
overtake the balance of the field battery.</p>

</div>

<p>Amos could almost feel that he too wore a
khaki uniform, and was speeding to the battle
line in order to take his share in the butchery,
the illusion was so complete.</p>

<p>It required more or less dexterity to turn part
way around in order to look where they were
going. Jack having a better grip than his chum
volunteered to do this duty, and report progress
from time to time.</p>

<p>“We’re overhauling the balance of the battery
all right, by slow degrees,” he told Amos. “I can
see signs of the village ahead there, now.”</p>

<p>“What’s left of it, I guess you mean, Jack,”
said Amos, sadly, “because you remember how<span class="pagenum">[279]</span>
we saw the German shells bursting in the streets,
and among the houses by the dozen. I’ll be more
than surprised if any buildings have been spared
after such a furious bombardment. Will we find
our host the old burgomaster alive, or poor little
Jacques still marching up and down with his
Belgian flag over his shoulder?”</p>

<p>“When the Germans were in the place at one
time he may have had his chance to spring his
trap and carry out that childish vow he made,”
suggested Jack. “It’s more than likely the poor
little chap has been sent to join his father by a
cruel German bayonet or a bursting shell.”</p>

<p>Several minutes later and Amos heard him
utter an exclamation of disappointment.</p>

<p>“What’s gone wrong now, Jack?” demanded
the other.</p>

<p>“Why, the battery has turned off the road, and
is heading through a field at left angles,” replied
Jack. “So we’ll have to drop off when we get
there and finish our journey to the village afoot.”</p>

<p>“Well, we got a mighty fine lift, all right,”
admitted Amos, “and shouldn’t complain. But<span class="pagenum">[280]</span>
they’re still at it hammer and tongs over there,
you notice. Those Germans never know when
they’re licked, do they? I reckon they’ve sent
up fresh columns of troops as many as ten times
against the new line of British and Canadians
organized. It’s nip and tuck between them, because
both sides are as stubborn as they make
them.”</p>

<p>“By this time the Kaiser has learned that the
British can fight as well as ever they could in the
past,” said Jack. “He called their army contemptible
in the beginning, but I believe he meant
in numbers, not bravery; and it was, compared
with the millions he could throw into the field
inside of two weeks, every man drilled and ready
to do his part. But here’s where we skip, and say
good-bye to our friends the gunners! They’ve
slackened up speed for us; so jump, Amos, and
be careful to land on your feet, not on your
nose!”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">WHAT LITTLE JACQUES DID.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Amos was smart enough to take all necessary
precautions when jumping. He did not meet
with any accident, and was in condition to wave
a jolly farewell to the gunners in khaki, who
had turned in their seats to see the last of the
American boys carrying that autograph letter
from the British commander.</p>

<p>“A rough and ready lot of fine chaps, I should
say, Jack,” remarked Amos, after they had
watched the caisson whirl past an obstruction
that shut it out from their view.</p>

<p>“Yes, and it’s tough to think that perhaps not
a corporal’s guard of the whole squad will ever
go back again to their English homes,” replied
the other. “To see the way they joke and make
merry I don’t believe that bothers one of them
the least bit. When you stop to think of it, the<span class="pagenum">[282]</span>
worst of a war in these times is that it takes
off so many hundreds of thousands of the finest
young men, leaving cripples, old fellows and those
who are of little use in the world.”</p>

<p>“Now I hadn’t thought of that before,” admitted
Amos, candidly. “It’s really a fact,
though, isn’t it? Every soldier nowadays has to
be physically sound, of a certain height, and even
his teeth are examined to make sure they’re fit.
When a million or two such athletes are cut off,
the old world is going to take a step backward
for years to come.”</p>

<p>“Let’s put our best foot forward, and get to
what’s left of the village, Amos.”</p>

<p>They trudged along for a little while in almost
absolute silence, each boy being busily occupied
with his own thoughts. Perhaps Amos, as would
be quite natural, was planning what arguments
he should use when he came upon his brother.
Jack on his part may have been thinking more
of the fate that had overtaken the poor Belgian
village which by the fortunes of war seemed to<span class="pagenum">[283]</span>
have been in the direct line of fire between the
hostile armies.</p>

<p>As they reached a certain little knoll they were
given an opportunity to take their first good look
at the place where they had passed that never-to-be-forgotten
night, when the roar of approaching
battle had stirred their young blood to fever
heat.</p>

<p>Amos uttered a cry in which astonishment was
mingled with pain. He even rubbed his eyes as
though he almost believed they had deceived him.</p>

<p>“Jack, it’s gone!” he gasped. “The poor village
I mean! Just see how the cottages have
been smashed to smithereens by the shells the
Germans hurled over here while the Allies were
holding the place! Oh! it’s terrible, terrible!
I don’t believe there are two stones on top of
each other.”</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t quite as bad as that, Amos,” said
his comrade, “because I can see several houses
still standing, though they’re wrecks at that.
But if ever there was a peaceful village turned
into a howling wilderness this one has been.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[284]</span></p>

<p>“But, Jack, what’s become of the people?”</p>

<p>“A whole lot of them were wise enough to
get away at the time we did,” Jack reminded
him. “You remember how we found them strung
out along the road. By now we hope they’ve
found lodging somewhere in Northern France;
for the French people have warm hearts, and
owe Belgium such a heavy debt for holding back
the Kaiser’s army that they will share their last
crust with their neighbors.”</p>

<p>“Still there were some who meant to stay here,
Jack?” urged Amos.</p>

<p>“That’s true enough,” came the answer, “and
our old landlord the burgomaster was of the
number, though I reckon he insisted on most of
his people going away. They had a good deep
cellar under that cottage, he told us; perhaps no
German shell buried itself down there to find
them out. Come, let’s head that way. I’ve got
an idea the one house we can see standing over
there is the very home where we were taken in.”</p>

<p>“I hope so, Jack, I surely do!” exclaimed the
other boy fervently. “I’d hate to learn that such<span class="pagenum">[285]</span>
a fine old man had been done for. If that is the
house, though, I’d never recognize it with the
corners torn off, and the chimney fallen in ruins.
Oh, Jack, see, there’s a gaping hole in the wall
showing where a shell passed through. If it
exploded inside we can guess the fate of all that
were hiding there.”</p>

<p>“Look again, Amos, and you’ll see that it came
out through that hole, and buried itself in the
ground right here. It was a German shell, of
course, as pretty much all that fell upon this place
must have been; for the British were behind the
houses holding the enemy off, and every effort
was made to chase them out.”</p>

<p>“But they held their ground, it seems like,”
said Amos, “and with the coming of reinforcements
pushed the Germans back a mile or more.
Now to find out what happened to the old burgomaster.</p>

<p>“Jack, tell me, isn’t that some one moving
around inside the ruins of the cottage?”</p>

<p>“I do believe you’re right, Amos. We’ll soon<span class="pagenum">[286]</span>
know who it is,” replied the Western boy, as he
made for the doorway.</p>

<p>The cottage could only be called a ruin, even
though its four walls still stood, and part of the
roof seemed to be fairly intact. A tree just outside
that had given grateful shade for many years
was stripped of its limbs, and the trunk stood like
a gaunt skeleton, a grim reminder of the furious
hail of bombs that had fallen upon that devoted
village for hours.</p>

<p>Jack had to almost climb over the mass of
debris that cumbered the open doorway. He
immediately found that the wrecked cottage did
have occupants. Several figures were stretched
upon blankets on the floor, and others hovered
over them, showing that the place was really
being used as a sort of hospital.</p>

<p>Jack immediately saw, however, that those
who were being thus attended were not soldiers
of the line. One was a woman, another an old
man, while the third seemed to be a small figure,
presumably that of a mere lad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[287]</span></p>

<p>A hand clutched Jack’s arm, and the voice of
his chum whispered hoarsely in his ear:</p>

<p>“Our old friend has come through it all with
his life, Jack; don’t you see him giving that boy
a drink, and passing his hand over the poor little
chap’s forehead? Seems to me I’ve set eyes on
that boy before, and&mdash;yes, as sure as anything,
Jack, I do believe it’s little Jacques. He’s been
struck down, just as we feared.”</p>

<p>“They seem to be hovering over him in a
strange way,” ventured Jack. “There’s a Belgian
soldier holding his other hand, and two
women doing what they can. Jacques doesn’t
lack for friends, it seems. I wonder what it all
means, and if he tried to carry out that foolish
vow he made about getting revenge for his
father’s death.”</p>

<p>Just then it happened that the old burgomaster,
who no longer had a village under his charge,
looked around. He may have heard the murmur
of their voices during some lull in the dreadful
chaos of sounds that came from the front, rising
and falling as the wind chanced to swerve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[288]</span></p>

<p>At sight of the two American boys his wrinkled
face showed great pleasure. He immediately got
up from his knees and hurried toward them, holding
out his hand in warm welcome.</p>

<p>“I am glad to see you again, young messieurs,”
he said, simply. “I wondered much what had
become of you, and prayed that you had escaped
the terrible shells that seemed to cover every mile
of territory around this poor village.”</p>

<p>Amos was conscious of a feeling of amazement.
He marveled greatly that the good old
man could spare even one thought for them, when
he himself was face to face with so overpowering
a peril. It certainly spoke well for his heart. No
wonder then that those who had lived in that
place had made him their burgomaster. In Belgium
that name stands not only for Mayor, but
father to the entire community, with an eye
single to the welfare of the “children” entrusted
to his care.</p>

<p>“We are glad, too, on finding that you escaped
when so many must have been killed or injured<span class="pagenum">[289]</span>
here, even while hidden in cellars,” Jack told
him.</p>

<p>The burgomaster shook his white head dismally.
There was an expression of woe on his
face, but in spite of all Jack could detect the
gleam of an unconquered spirit in those unflinching
eyes. The Kaiser might overrun Belgium
with his soldiers, and hold every foot of soil, but
he would never be able to crush the independence
of soul that has always been the common heritage
of every Belgian.</p>

<p>“It has been a terrible calamity,” he said,
simply. “We bow our heads before the storm,
even as the trees do when the wind blows, and the
thunder rolls. But after it is all over they raise
their crests again. So, too, young messieurs, will
Belgium rise from the ruins of her cities and
towns to become greater than before.”</p>

<p>How proudly he said that. Amos would never
forget the exalted look on the seamed face of
the old burgomaster. Somehow he found it in
his heart to believe every word of that prophecy
must in the course of time come true.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[290]</span></p>

<p>“These wounded persons, did they get their
injuries while down in the cellar? Was it a shell
that exploded there to scatter death around?”
Jack asked, nodding toward the group hovering
around the blankets on the floor, upon which
those forms were stretched.</p>

<p>“Heaven was merciful in that nothing like that
came upon us,” the old man hastened to inform
him. “They received their hurts outside, as did
others who are now being cared for amidst the
ruins of our poor houses, by some of those who
remained with me in shelter.”</p>

<p>“And how about little Jacques?” asked Amos,
unable to hold his curiosity in check any longer.</p>

<p>The burgomaster allowed his grim features to
relax for a brief moment in what was almost a
smile; though with so much suffering around
him it sat strangely upon his face. He nodded
his head several times as he went on to say:</p>

<p>“Ah! young M’sieu, that is the most remarkable
thing I ever knew to happen. Yes, it is
little Jacques you see there on the blanket. He
has been injured, but we hope and believe he<span class="pagenum">[291]</span>
will recover. He surely will if our prayers are
of any avail; for, wonderful to say, little Jacques
is this day a hero of heroes!”</p>

<p>At that Amos uttered a pleased cry.</p>

<p>“Oh! do you really mean to tell us the little
chap actually found his chance after all? What
did he do&mdash;what could so small a boy do against
the fighting soldiers of the Kaiser? Please tell
us all about it.”</p>

<p>“It was in this way,” described the burgomaster,
proudly. “When the Germans came into the
village after that first furious bombardment they
managed to hold half of the place. There was
fighting in every street, desperate hand-to-hand
fighting, for those British were determined they
would not be chased out wholly. This kept up
until the reinforcements arrived on the run, wild
with the lust for blood. Then step by step the
Germans were pressed back, until in the end they
lost their grip on the village.”</p>

<p>“After that the bombardment must have
started in afresh, until the whole place was leveled
as flat as a plain?” interposed Jack, wishing<span class="pagenum">[292]</span>
to get all the facts clearly in his mind, for future
use in his letters to the paper he represented.</p>

<p>“Just as you say, young M’sieu,” continued the
burgomaster. “It was while the Germans held
part of the town that Jacques found his great
opportunity. Two of the invaders discovered
him there on the street amidst all that furious
firing back and forth. They seized hold of the
lad, and, I believe, threatened him with death if
he did not reveal the place where his people were
hiding with their valuables. The boy played his
part well, and after making out that he was almost
frightened to death agreed to lead them to
our hiding place.”</p>

<p>“Oh! he always claimed that he had a trap
ready to spring!” exclaimed Amos, who found
himself intensely interested in the story. “Did
those two Germans really fall into it, Monsieur?”</p>

<p>“He must have acted his part wonderfully
well,” said the old man proudly, for it must be
remembered that the lad’s father was his own
cousin. “He made them force him along; for in
some manner he succeeded in lulling any suspicions<span class="pagenum">[293]</span>
they may have had in the start. And,
Messieurs, in the end Jacques, a Belgian boy with
a heart that beats only for his beloved country,
managed to entrap those two pillagers, so that
they are now prisoners in the hands of our
forces.”</p>

<p>“But how could he do such a wonderful thing?”
asked Amos, not skeptically, for he fully believed
every word the burgomaster spoke, but with a
keen desire to know all the particulars.</p>

<p>“Ah! we none of us understand as yet, for
Jacques has been too weak to explain,” the old
man told them. “Besides, something else has
occurred to claim his attention. What we know
is that after the British reclaimed the ruins of
our poor village, and the Germans had been
beaten back as many as six times, on coming
out from my hiding place to see what could be
done for those who were lying by scores and
hundreds around, I found the boy badly injured
by a fragment of a bursting shell.</p>

<p>“He seemed feverish with but one desire, and
that to tell where two German soldiers could be<span class="pagenum">[294]</span>
found shut in a hole in the ground. I found a
British officer who sent some of his men to the
place, and it was as Jacques had said. A great
rock had been toppled over so as to fill in the gap,
and this he must have learned some time ago
could be hurled down with even a child’s puny
strength. And that, young Messieurs, was the
trap Jacques always hinted to us about, but at
which we only smiled.”</p>

<p>“Bully for little Jacques!” exclaimed Amos,
carried away with boyish enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“When he saw the soldiers passing by with the
two Germans in their charge Jacques, although
in great pain, laughed in glee, for the one great
hope of his life had been realized,” continued
the burgomaster, “but even then he did not know
what else there was waiting for him. As the
story of his valor went around many of the British
soldiers came here to see the Belgian boy
who had captured two big Germans alone and
unaided. We even had a general visit us, and
tell the lad how proud he was that the sons of
their allies should display such valor. But while<span class="pagenum">[295]</span>
this may have pleased Jacques there was something
else coming that overwhelmed him with
joy.”</p>

<p>Jack started at hearing this. Somehow he
suddenly remembered that man in the stained
uniform of a Belgian soldier who was bending
over the little figure of the boy hero, and one of
whose arms seemed to be swathed in bandages.</p>

<p>“That soldier over there, who holds his hand
on the head of Jacques, and looks down at him
so tenderly, is his father, supposed to have
fallen at Antwerp?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is as you say, young M’sieu; he lived,
and has come to claim his boy!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum">[296]</span>
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXV" class="no-break">CHAPTER XXV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">NEARING THE GOAL.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“That’s splendid news,” Jack at once remarked.
“I’m glad for the sake of little Jacques
that his brave father did not die there in front
of Antwerp as you all believed. If I had time
I’d like to hear his story, because I reckon it’d
be well worth listening to. But we have business
of our own to look after, and so must once
more take leave of you.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he will get well again?” asked
Amos, who under different conditions, would
only too willingly have volunteered to help take
care of the wounded, since his education as a
Boy Scout had taught him how to apply the
principles of “first aid to the injured.”</p>

<p>“We have strong hopes,” replied the old burgomaster.
“Joy is better than all the medicine a
doctor can bring. Jacques has found his father<span class="pagenum">[297]</span>
again; and besides, his young heart is filled with
happiness because he was given a chance to strike
a blow against the enemies of his country. Yes,
he surely must get well now, and live to see a
new day dawn for Belgium.”</p>

<p>They both went over to nod to the boy, and the
look of contentment upon his face told them his
severe wounds were at the time forgotten in
the thanksgiving that filled his heart. Both of
them would in time to come often think of
Jacques, and hope the good angel that had
brought back his father would continue to guard
the boy’s further fortunes.</p>

<p>Once again Jack and Amos found themselves
outside, and wandering amidst the ruins of the
village where only recently the fighting had
reached its height. Here was the high-tide mark
of that furious German drive; just as Gettysburg
marked the apex of the Lost Cause in the war
between the States in ’63. Jack wondered
whether history would repeat itself, for he believed
that if Germany were defeated it would
only be through the force of greater numbers<span class="pagenum">[298]</span>
arrayed against her, with pretty much all the
world in arms.</p>

<p>They wandered around seeking some means of
learning where they could secure the information
they required. Never would they forget the
sights that greeted them on every side. The
ground looked almost as though it had been
ploughed, such were the number of shells that
had fallen on that devoted village during the
time it was under bombardment. To Amos it
seemed incredible that any living thing could have
remained there and lived through that holocaust
of crashing shells; and yet those undaunted men
in khaki must have found some sort of concealment,
for every time the Teuton force charged,
after a cessation in the firing, they were met by
the British, and mowed down by the Maxims that
were hurriedly brought to bear on the solid ranks
coming forward.</p>

<p>Most of the wounded had been removed by
now, and were being taken to the rear in the
motor vans, lorries, and Red Cross ambulances.
The dead for the most part lay where they had<span class="pagenum">[299]</span>
fallen, though several gangs of men stumbled
among the gruesome piles, and seemed to be
engaged in placing them in shallow graves, after
securing the identification medals which every
soldier wore about his neck, so that his fate might
be made known to his sorrowing people at home.</p>

<p>Again and again were the boys stopped, and
asked what business they had there in the midst
of such harrowing scenes. On every occasion
Jack showed the order from the commanding
general, which was couched in no uncertain
words, and invariably produced the desired effect,
for all opposition was immediately removed.</p>

<p>They had been instructed whom they must ask
for in order to learn whether Frank Bradford
was still hard at work serving the Allies as a
daring aviator. No one was likely to possess this
information save some of his comrades, or the
chief of the aerial staff, in whose charge all
these operations had been placed.</p>

<p>For two hours did the boys walk after leaving
the ruined village. Sometimes they were misinformed,
for changes were being made rapidly<span class="pagenum">[300]</span>
in those stirring times, and Headquarters today
might be miles away from where it had been
twelve hours before.</p>

<p>“It’s a long run, trying to find that officer,”
remarked Amos, who of course was racked constantly
by his hopes and fears, and wished the
crisis would hurry along, so that he might know
what to expect.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” admitted the cheerful Jack, “but
all the time we’re getting warmer and warmer
on the trail. Right now I can see where that last
monoplane rose from, and the chances are we’ll
find the party we’re looking for at that spot.”</p>

<p>“It gives me the queerest sort of feeling, Jack,
just to believe that any minute now I may be
squeezing Frank’s hand, and looking into his
eyes again. I was always mighty fond of my big
brother, you know, and it nearly broke my heart,
small chap that I really was at the time, when
he told me he was going away forever, because
our father had unjustly accused him of doing
something which he denied. If only I find him<span class="pagenum">[301]</span>
safe and sound I’ll be the happiest fellow in all
Europe.”</p>

<p>“Except one, perhaps, Amos, and that’s little
Jacques, whose father came back to him from
the dead.”</p>

<p>“Well, finding Frank and carrying him home
with me will be almost like the same thing, for
he’s been as dead to us for many years!” declared
Amos, eagerly watching the aeroplane
that was now soaring swiftly aloft, already a
target for hostile fire, as the little white puffs of
smoke told where the shrapnel shells were bursting
all around the daring pilot. “I’m wondering
again whether that can be Frank up yonder, and
if he’ll come back safely. It would be a terrible
thing if something happened to him just when
I had run him down.”</p>

<p>“Oh! don’t allow yourself to give way to such
an idea,” said Jack. “Look on the bright side
of things all the time. Think how we’ve been
carried through our troubles so splendidly. No
matter how dark things seemed they always took
a turn for the better in the end, and every time<span class="pagenum">[302]</span>
it proved the best thing that could have happened
to us.”</p>

<p>With an effort the boy managed to get a better
hold upon himself. This companionship with
Jack was the luckiest thing that could ever have
happened to Amos; for the Western lad always
seemed to steady him at times when his nerves
were sorely tried, so as to give him renewed
strength of purpose.</p>

<p>“There goes another ’plane up, Jack!” he exclaimed
a minute later. “That first pilot, now
high over the German lines, seems to be holding
his own in spite of all the shrapnel they can send
after him. Yes, you must be right in saying
we’re coming to where we will find the controlling
force of the aviation corps. Before another half
hour goes by I’m likely to know the best&mdash;or the
worst!”</p>

<p>“You’ll be wringing Frank’s hand and telling
him how proud you are to learn that the boldest
of all the Allied aviators, known under the name
of Frank Bradford, is your own dear brother&mdash;make
up your mind to that!” said Jack, sturdily,<span class="pagenum">[303]</span>
for he saw that his chum was trembling with
suspense.</p>

<p>When one has dreamed and thought of a certain
object for days and weeks, and it comes
time when he may know the truth, small wonder
that he shivers with alternate hope and dread.
Amos was only human. You and I most likely
would feel the same nervousness under similar
conditions.</p>

<p>Amos uttered a cry of dismay, as though he
had received a sudden shock.</p>

<p>“Oh! Jack, they did get that second pilot, you
see!” he exclaimed. “He’s volplaning down now
like everything, and will fall inside the German
lines perhaps!”</p>

<p>“No, he’s heading this way!” declared Jack.
“From the fact that they’re still keeping up their
fire I reckon they fear he’ll escape them. The
pilot couldn’t have been badly hurt when his
’plane was struck, because I can see him sitting
up and managing his machine. It was only his
motor that was put out of commission, and if<span class="pagenum">[304]</span>
he keeps on as he’s going now he’ll get safely
down.”</p>

<p>“There, he’s disappeared behind that line of
trees!” cried Amos, “but the firing has nearly
stopped, so they must think it’s no use wasting
any more ammunition on him. Let’s hurry,
Jack! I’m wild to know if that was my brother.
Something just seems to tell me it must have
been. Ten minutes more ought to take us over
there where he came down. Just to think of it,
only that short time, and I’ll see him, if I’m
lucky!”</p>

<p>Apparently Jack was as intent upon settling
the question as Amos himself could be. He put
on more speed, and side by side they broke into
a run, such was their eagerness to cover the
intervening ground. Men in khaki looked after
them in bewilderment, not knowing who these
two boys were, or what object they could have
in thus braving the fearful ordeals to be encountered
on a battlefield.</p>

<p>Amos was caring little for all this. He had
but one object in view, and that the settling of<span class="pagenum">[305]</span>
the question whether his long absent brother
Frank, now one of the Allies’ aviators, was working
on that section of the firing line, and if he
was fated to meet him face to face after so
arduous a search.</p>

<p>Whether Amos and his faithful chum Jack
were to be rewarded with immediate success after
their eventful hunt for the missing Frank, or
meet with still further disappointment, must,
however, be left to another story, which the
reader will find ready for his perusal later on.</p>

<p>The launching of this Twentieth Century series marks
the inauguration of a new era in boys’ books&mdash;the
“wonders of modern science” epoch. Frank and Harry
Chester, the <span class="smcap">Boy Aviators</span>, are the heroes of this exciting,
red-blooded tale of adventure by air and land in
the turbulent Central American republic. The two
brothers with their $10,000 prize aeroplane, the <span class="smcap">Golden
Eagle</span>, rescue a chum from death in the clutches of the
Nicaraguans, discover a lost treasure valley of the ancient
Toltec race, and in so doing almost lose their own
lives in the Abyss of the White Serpents, and have many
other exciting experiences, including being blown far
out to sea in their air-skimmer in a tropical storm. It
would be unfair to divulge the part that wireless plays
in rescuing them from their predicament. In a brand
new field of fiction for boys, the Chester brothers and
their aeroplane seem destined to fill a top-notch place.
These books are technically correct, wholesomely thrilling
and geared up to third speed.</p>

<p>In this live-wire narrative of peril and adventure,
laid in the Everglades of Florida, the
spunky Chester Boys and their interesting
chums, including Ben Stubbs, the maroon,
encounter exciting experiences on Uncle Sam’s
service in a novel field. One must read this
vivid, enthralling story of incident, hardship
and pluck to get an idea of the almost limitless
possibilities of the two greatest inventions
of modern times&mdash;the aeroplane and wireless
telegraphy. While gripping and holding the
reader’s breathless attention from the opening
words to the finish, this swift-moving story is
at the same time instructive and uplifting. As
those readers who have already made friends
with Frank and Harry Chester and their
“bunch” know, there are few difficulties, no
matter how insurmountable they may seem at
first blush, that these up-to-date gritty youths
cannot overcome with flying colors. A clean-cut,
real boys’ book of high voltage.</p>

<p class="boxtitle1">The Boy Aviators in Africa<br />
<span class="boxtitle2">Or, An Aerial Ivory Trail</span></p>

<p>In this absorbing book we meet, on a Continent made
famous by the American explorer Stanley, and ex-President
Roosevelt, our old friends, the Chester Boys and
their stalwart chums. In Africa&mdash;the Dark Continent&mdash;the
author follows in exciting detail his young heroes,
their voyage in the first aeroplane to fly above the mysterious
forests and unexplored ranges of the mystic land.
In this book, too, for the first time, we entertain Luther
Barr, the old New York millionaire, who proved later
such an implacable enemy of the boys. The story of his
defeated schemes, of the astonishing things the boys discovered
in the Mountains of the Moon, of the pathetic
fate of George Desmond, the emulator of Stanley, the
adventure of the Flying Men and the discovery of the
Arabian Ivory cache,&mdash;this is not the place to speak. It
would be spoiling the zest of an exciting tale to reveal
the outcome of all these episodes here. It may be said,
however, without “giving away” any of the thrilling
chapters of this narrative, that Captain Wilbur Lawton,
the author, is in it in his best vein, and from his personal
experiences in Africa has been able to supply a striking
background for the adventures of his young heroes. As
one newspaper says of this book: “Here is adventure in
good measure, pressed down and running over.”</p></div>

<p class="boxtitle1">The Boy Aviators’ Treasure Quest<br />
<span class="boxtitle2">Or, The Golden Galleon</span></p>

<p>Everybody is a boy once more when it comes to the
question of hidden treasure. In this book, Captain Lawton
has set forth a hunt for gold that is concealed neither
under the sea nor beneath the earth, but is well hidden
for all that. A garrulous old sailor, who holds the key
to the mystery of the Golden Galleon, plays a large
part in the development of the plot of this fascinating
narrative of treasure hunting in the region of the Gulf
Stream and the Sagasso Sea. An aeroplane fitted with efficient
pontoons&mdash;enabling her to skim the water successfully&mdash;has
long been a dream of aviators. The Chester
Boys seem to have solved the problem. The Sagasso,
that strange drifting ocean within an ocean, holding ships
of a dozen nations and a score of ages in its relentless
grip, has been the subject of many books of adventure
and mystery, but in none has the secret of the ever
shifting mass of treacherous currents been penetrated as
it has in the BOY AVIATORS’ TREASURE QUEST.
Luther Barr, whom it seemed the boys had shaken off,
is still on their trail, in this absorbing book and with a
dirigible balloon, essays to beat them out in their search
for the Golden Galleon. Every boy, every man&mdash;and
woman and girl&mdash;who has ever felt the stirring summons
of adventure in their souls, had better get hold of this
book. Once obtained, it will be read and re-read till
it falls to rags.</p></div>

<p>The Chester Boys in new field of endeavor&mdash;an attempt
to capture a newspaper prize for a trans-continental flight.
By the time these lines are read, exactly such an offer
will have been spread, broadcast by one of the foremost
newspapers of the country. In the Golden Eagle, the
boys, accompanied by a trail-blazing party in an automobile,
make the dash. But they are not alone in their
aspirations. Their rivals for the rich prize at stake try
in every way that they can to circumvent the lads and
gain the valuable trophy and monetary award. In this
they stop short at nothing, and it takes all the wits and
resources of the Boy Aviators to defeat their devices.
Among the adventures encountered in their cross-country
flight, the boys fall in with a band of rollicking cowboys&mdash;who
momentarily threaten serious trouble&mdash;are attacked
by Indians, strike the most remarkable town of the
desert&mdash;the “dry” town of “Gow Wells,” encounter a
sandstorm which blows them into strange lands far to the
south of their course, and meet with several amusing
mishaps beside. A thoroughly readable book. The sort
to take out behind the barn on the sunny side of the haystack,
and, with a pocketful of juicy apples and your heels
kicking the air, pass happy hours with Captain Lawton’s
young heroes.</p></div>

<p class="boxtitle1">The Boy Aviators’ Polar Dash<br />
<span class="boxtitle2">Or, Facing Death in the Antarctic</span></p>

<p>If you were to hear that two boys, accompanying a South
Polar expedition in charge of the aeronautic department,
were to penetrate the Antarctic regions&mdash;hitherto only
attained by a few daring explorers&mdash;you would feel interested,
wouldn’t you? Well, in Captain Lawton’s latest
book, concerning his Boy Aviators, you can not only read
absorbing adventure in the regions south of the eightieth
parallel, but absorb much useful information as well.
Captain Lawton introduces&mdash;besides the original characters
of the heroes&mdash;a new creation in the person of Professor
Simeon Sandburr, a patient seeker for polar insects.
The professor’s adventures in his quest are the
cause of much merriment, and lead once or twice to
serious predicaments. In a volume so packed with incident
and peril from cover to cover&mdash;relieved with laughable
mishaps to the professor&mdash;it is difficult to single out any
one feature; still, a recent reader of it wrote the publishers
an enthusiastic letter the other day, saying: “The
episodes above the Great Barrier are thrilling, the attack
of the condors in Patagonia made me hold my breath
the&mdash;but what’s the use? The Polar Dash, to my mind,
is an even more entrancing book than Captain Lawton’s
previous efforts, and that’s saying a good deal. The aviation
features and their technical correctness are by no
means the least attractive features of this up-to-date
creditable volume.”</p></div>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
